Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=
 of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=
 bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=
 deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=
ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=
us is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=
ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=
nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double=
 dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=
islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=
e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=
e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=
g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=
hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =
breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=
e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=
ll be very difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=
e would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=
 Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =
$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=
l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=
 will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=
ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=
k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=
r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=
ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=
ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =
paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=
kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20
=20
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=
ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =
the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =
of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=
icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=
 to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=
rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=
ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=
he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=
 authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=
horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=
tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =
going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=
ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =
has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =
that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=
urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =
is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=
ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=
ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=
dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=
ier in the crisis.
=20
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=
he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=
gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=
o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=
igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=
s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=
es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=
ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=
suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=
tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=
en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=
ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=
assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=
 bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=
 the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

For what its worth........

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

Andrew Ozuna
Real Estate Loan Officer

Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

"George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626

Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>



Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position 
and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that 
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

"Gentlemen,

Due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land option 
agreement.  The most significant change is that it is clear that the option 
payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the purchase 
price.  There is also a clarification in paragraph 9 (re assignment) that the 
assignee remains responsible for any liability arising prior to assignment.  

I believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are.  Please 
advise if this version is acceptable.  Also, please let me know if you would 
like for me to have a redline version prepared.

I would hestitate to give up the option to TurboPark this project, unless the 
commercial team commits that there is no way Enron will ever want to progress 
with the site beyond permitting.  As you know, there is no going back once we 
give up that optionality.  

Good catch, Renee.

Project - Broward County, FL  

Right, Renee. We don't want to do sonething that might inadvertently bust any 
eventual off-balance sheet treatment that might apply. 

Hey, Ann. FYI, our usual form of PSA and Tasking Letter didn't fit these off 
balance structures on Mr. Clark's Ft. Pierce job. There was something of a 
controversy as a result and they had to be re-worked. We don't want to go 
there again.

Kay, Ann, and Steve, do you know if  this project is to be Turbo-Parked and 
if so is the work  that you need the PSA and TL hard cost or soft cost? If 
it's to be Turbo Parked, let's work from the  forms Bart developed for Ft. 
Pierce. Renee, please copy Ann on each draft you turn out, including before 
you launch to the other side. 

I am out of the office this week,but checking e-mail and voice mail about 
once a day.  Please leat a voice mail for me at 713-646-6309 if you need me.

John,

I have received the following request for a PSA and Tasking Letter between 
ENA and EDSA from Steve Rose.  I want to make sure that the Deerfield 
Project, part of the Florida Greenfield Projects, is not being done through 
Off-Balance Sheet Financing, as this would preclude us from using the PSA 
form of contract.  To this end, I am copying Ann Elizabeth White, the ENA 
attorney on the Florida Greenfield Projects.

Once it is determined whether a PSA and Tasking Letter is acceptable for the 
work, I will proceed accordingly.  

If the Florida Greenfields are being financed through Turbo Park, I believe 
Bart Clark has a Turbo Park form for the landscape artitecture firm being 
used on the Ft. Pierce Project and I could try getting a copy of that from 
him.

Thanks

Renee,

I let you a voice mail message about this on Friday.  We have up until now 
been using the landscape architecture firm of Curtis-Rogers, working under a 
subcontract with Parsons Brinckerhoff, on the Deerfield Beach and South Dade 
sites.  Steve Krimsky has decided that he wants to use EDSA (another 
landscape architecture firm we've used on Pompano Beach) to complete the 
landscaping design work on Deerfield Beach, and to have them work directly 
for ENA rather than as a sub to PB.  I've already discussed this at length 
with Doug Smith, one of the principals at EDSA, and have e-mailed him a large 
quantity of design information and got EDSA kicked off to do the work.  Doug 
is supposed to send me a summary of EDSA's NTE costs for the tasks I 
identified to him, which I will forward to you as soon as I get it.

EDSA is now working on the Deerfield Beach landscaping on the basis of my 
conversation and e-mail, and their preliminary deliverables are due Friday 
March 16 (i.e., the end of this week).  We need to get a PSA and TL set up 
between ENA and EDSA to formalize this arrangement.  I would like you to 
draft these two documents ASAP so that we can get the proper contract 
documents in place as quickly as possible.

I will forward to you via separate e-mails the various documentation you will 
need to help put this together.

I'm working at home today (typical ENA vacation day!), so you can reach me on 
my cell or at home if you want to talk about this.

My numbers are:

Cell:  713-854-4971
Home:  281-655-0185

Leatha,

I have a couple of questions.  Do your numbers assume $7500 down (in
addition to the tax etc), and is the term 36 months or 48?  Both time
frames are mentioned in your explanation.

Have we heard anything on the remarketing of my Lexus?  Does the cost
include the tax trade on the Lexus?

Let me know what you think.

Leatha




Hi Leatha,

Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it,
however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the
extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we
asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.
They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.
When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the
wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount
the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get
reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to
""work on it"".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my
Lexus.

Thanks,

Kay

Seyi,

James MacCallon has now left for Mexico.  I am just returning from India and
must step in where he left off.  I see James has sent a few emails and faxes 
to
you but I can find no reply from AA although there is a 14-July email from you
indicating a reply would be sent by 16-July.   Have you sent a reply and I 
have
missed it?

Given that the commercial team is now at a critical point and needs to
understand the Nigeria tax implications for the venture and bid, perhaps we
should short-cut this Q&A process and have a conference call.  I would suggest
early AM Tuesday 20th, what works for you?

During the call, John Rigby can provide background on the project then we can
discuss the questions James sent you earlier (12th, 16th-AM, 16th-PM).
Additionally, I would like to confirm whether the attached Nigeria Tax Chart
(TC-NIGE-Elf...) is still valid and touch on the below topics:

   Are construction activities conducted approx. 30-35 miles offshore Nigeria
   subject to Nigeria income tax if paid by a Nigerian client (i.e., Elf
   Petroleum Nigeria, Ltd.)?  I recall from advice AA provided 2nd 
quarter-1998
   there is an issue as to whether offshore construction services are 
""consumed""
   in Nigeria.
   The bid package suggest Elf will withhold taxes unless Contractor provides
   ""official documents unquestionably enacting an exemption from any 
withholdng
   in connection with the Contract.""  If the offshore Nigeria activities were
   outside Nigeria territorial waters, would it be possible to obtain such an
   exemption certification?
   Is it still necessary for a foreign company to form a Nigerian subsidiary 
to
   conduct business in Nigeria?  I recall that at one point Branches need
   special approval which was difficult to obtain but James informed me this 
has
   changed.
   Have you commonly seen Nigerian and non-Nigerian companies enter into
   consortiums or contractual joint ventures to execute a construction project
   in Nigeria?  Are there any special issues Enron should be aware of?
   In the past, a company subject to Nigeria net income tax may have fully
   satisfied its tax liability with advance taxes retained by its client.
   However, due to the lack of physical receipts,  there was no allowed credit
   for these advance taxes.  Is this still the case?  Are you familiar with
   contractual language used by the Contractor to protect his tax position and
   ensure receipts are provided in a timely manner?  Elf has suggested it 
would
   provide receipts ""when they are received from the relevant Tax Authority"" 
but
   this provides little (or no) comfort based on my prior dealings with 
Nigeria.
   The bid package language on VAT is somewhat troubling.  It suggests
   Contractor must furnish a copy of its VAT registration before issuing its
   first invoice.  It goes on to add that VAT which may be legally payable by
   Elf in respect of non-resident Contractor invoices ""shall be paid and
   collected in accordance with the applicable Nigerian Tax laws and
   Regulations.""  Can you confirm this would not allow Elf to withhold VAT 
from
   Contractor under a so called ""reverse charge VAT"" mechanism?

I look forward to hearing from you.  If wish to call me, my direct line is
713-345-6420.  My fax line is 713-646-7151.

Regards.

confirming today's calls, westinghouse is asking enron whether we'd consider 
the following settlement of the ""north america peaker/panama/electrocities"" 
gtg issue, particularly as it relates to the damaged generator (again, plz 
understand that this is not a formal offer at this time; will come within 
days depending on our response.  westinghouse does not want to go to their 
senior management with a ""settlement"" offer without knowing that enron will 
respond favorably when formally presented; i.e., just a waste of time for all 
concerned):

westinghouse will re-imburse enron asap with money's paid to date by enron to 
westinghouse.  note - westinghouse is willing to consider taking back the gtg 
for what enron paid westinghouse, BUT NO addl monies will be offerred or 
considered.  this is a ""ceiling.""
money to be wired within days of settlement agreement.
westinghouse takes back the unit ""as-is.""
no further claims/rights of action between the parties on this gtg/contract.
this potential of an offer from westinghouse has a life span of just a few 
days (i.e., this week).  westinghouse is ""long"" on D5A machines and for them 
to take this one back into the fold will present them with marketing 
challenges in 2001.

pros
brings cash back to enron on the balance sheet before end of year.
we don't currently have a use for this gtg in an enron project.  (i.e., 
unless an idc treatment can be agreed, project's now can't typically afford 
this unit).
we don't currently have an anticipated use for this gtg in the next 6 to 9 
months in an enron project.
we don't have to pay for storage; i.e., such costs are already accruing.
dispute resolution (per contract) consists of senior management meeting 
seeking to settle; if unable, the remedy is the n.y. courts.  therefore, we 
can avoid lawsuit.  therefore, we'll save on outside legal costs.
as part of settlement, we can possibly secure an option forward or first 
right of refussal on a ""f"" or ""g"" machine for projects in 2002.
by settling now, this avoids further month by month increases in idc.

cons
idc costs to be written off by ena (or elsewhere?).

for ben - plz advise.  dan shultz, kay mann (hopefully) and scott laidlaw are 
available to meet today on this issue.  regards.  scott.

Gregg:

We should register Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C. (""Midwest"") for Sales & Use Tax 
in those states in which Midwest has nexus.  Nexus requires a physical 
presence (employees or inventory).  If Midwest, in foreign states (outside of 
Illinois), is merely purchasing and selling natural gas, for delivery by 
common carrier; Midwest does not have nexus.  Rather, Midwest is acting much 
like a mail order seller.  

In light of the above, could you please advise regarding Midwest's physical 
presence in Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and 
Wisconsin.  Thanks.

Murrell regarding the impending name change of Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C.  My 
understanding is that we have already bought/sold natural gas in Oklahoma, 
Texas, and Louisianna.  The remaining states in his e-mail are potential 
future places of business.  I will leave it up to your discretion as to how 
you want to pursue registering for taxes in these locales.  I am guessing we 
may want to register in those states we have already transacted in.  Please 
let me know what you think we should do.

Mark Lay:  Again, thank you for listening to my concept.  In my search for 
co-foounder/collaborators and
angel investors, disclosing the concept (for lack of a better title now, I 
call the system ""LifeTrak"")
and formulating a simple, clear picture is not easy.  The attached schematic 
depicts an overview of the
effort.  Part of the diagram hopes to separate the special interests as 
participants and member
organizations so as to be helpful in the public sector with social issues.  
The groups fall into two
natural sectors;  (1) supply generators; and (2) user/service organizations.  
In the middle is the system
and its management that interconnects those benefiting groups and the 
donor/recipient LifeTrak
cardholders.  I can embellish more on these later.  The diagram gives us a 
place to begin discuss and
talking points in order to try to simplify how the concept could be developed 
and supported and where the
revenue model which creates dramatic efficiencies generates management and 
license fee.  I hope we can
get together soon.  Although Vince Kaminski cannot directly contribute due to 
his other commitments, I
have copied him to keep him advised (hoping that he might be able to do more 
at a later date.).  Best

Vince-

Here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church.

First off, it appears from the data that a special ""appeal"" for fund giving 
was made (from the pulpit?) on April 19, 1998 and April 25, 1999, (perhaps 
tied rhetorically into Income Taxes?). Then, by going back and incorporating 
obvious dates from the calendars for 1997-1999, the following regression 
analysis is made, where each effect is added independently:

giving this Sunday = $4403

+ a minor $3 weekly time trend (i.e., multiply by the number of weeks since 
Jan. 5, 1997)

+ no pure effect from last week's contributions (i.e., denies first-order 
autoregressive effects)

+ $2426 if Easter Sunday or the Sunday nearest Christmas

+ $9695 if (pastoral appeal) April 19,1998 or April 25,1999

- $340 if the Sunday falls on the weekend of a Monday Federal holiday

- $50 if the Sunday following Thanksgiving

- $73  if a Summer weekend (June 1 thru August 31)

The pure time trend is very small, so an annual projection based on all 3 
years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ($150) for 
2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this April.

Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
?
This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the 
GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th 
February, 2001.
?
Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP 2000. 
There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention. Delegate 
bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are 
set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention  earlier this year. 
The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very 
well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course 
provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event.
?
Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:
?
1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th 
December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a 
delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New 
York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can 
appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken 
into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as 
possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your 
presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a 
laptop.
?
2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual 
requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably 
PowerPoint). 
?
3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you 
have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my 
colleague, Claire as soon as possible.
?
If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me, 
otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.
?
I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas

Hi, Vince,

How are you doing? I called Wed to set up a meeting with you, unfortunately 
you were out of town. Since I just got my computer and email account set up 
today, it was not that convenient to contact you. Please let me know when you 
are available. Please see the following for the interesting article about 
Enron, and it is exactly what you have been worried about and now it is 
starting to catch Wall Street's attention. So I belive what you have been 
promoting to do is very constructive to the company.

In addition, please let me know if you need any help with Tiger Team. I 
didn't forget yesterday's conference, but I was so tied up in a meeting and 
couldn't leave. The learning curve is quite steep for a freshhand like me at 
the very beginning. 

You are such a remarkable person, and I feel lucky I got the chance to work 
for you. I really appreciate your help and your kindness to me, and I benefit 
from it tremendously. Please please let me know if there is anything I could 
help.

Best Wishes!

Is Enron Overpriced?
It's in a bunch of complex businesses. Its financial
statements are nearly impenetrable. So why is Enron
trading at such a huge multiple?
Bethany McLean

03/05/2001
Fortune Magazine
122+
(Copyright 2001)

   In Hollywood parlance, the ""It Girl"" is someone who commands the
spotlight at any given moment--you know, like Jennifer Lopez or Kate
Hudson. Wall Street is a far less glitzy place, but there's still
such a thing as an ""It Stock."" Right now, that title belongs to
Enron, the Houston energy giant. While tech stocks were bombing at
the box office last year, fans couldn't get enough of Enron, whose
shares returned 89%. By almost every measure, the company turned in a
virtuoso performance: Earnings increased 25%, and revenues more than
doubled, to over $100 billion. Not surprisingly, the critics are
gushing. ""Enron has built unique and, in our view, extraordinary
franchises in several business units in very large markets,"" says
Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer.

   Along with ""It"" status come high multiples and high expectations.
Enron now trades at roughly 55 times trailing earnings. That's more
than 2 1/2 times the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy, more
than twice that of the S&P 500, and about on a par with new-economy
sex symbol Cisco Systems. Enron has an even higher opinion of itself.
At a late-January meeting with analysts in Houston, the company
declared that it should be valued at $126 a share, more than 50%
above current levels. ""Enron has no shame in telling you what it's
worth,"" says one portfolio manager, who describes such gatherings as
""revival meetings."" Indeed, First Call says that 13 of Enron's 18
analysts rate the stock a buy.
   But for all the attention that's lavished on Enron, the company
remains largely impenetrable to outsiders, as even some of its
admirers are quick to admit. Start with a pretty straightforward
question: How exactly does Enron make its money? Details are hard to
come by because Enron keeps many of the specifics confidential for
what it terms ""competitive reasons."" And the numbers that Enron does
present are often extremely complicated. Even quantitatively minded
Wall Streeters who scrutinize the company for a living think so. ""If
you figure it out, let me know,"" laughs credit analyst Todd Shipman
at S&P. ""Do you have a year?"" asks Ralph Pellecchia, Fitch's credit
analyst, in response to the same question.

   To skeptics, the lack of clarity raises a red flag about Enron's
pricey stock. Even owners of the stock aren't uniformly sanguine.
""I'm somewhat afraid of it,"" admits one portfolio manager. And the
inability to get behind the numbers combined with ever higher
expectations for the company may increase the chance of a nasty
surprise. ""Enron is an earnings-at-risk story,'' says Chris Wolfe,
the equity market strategist at J.P. Morgan's private bank, who
despite his remark is an Enron fan. ""If it doesn't meet earnings,
[the stock] could implode.""

   What's clear is that Enron isn't the company it was a decade ago.
In 1990 around 80% of its revenues came from the regulated gas-
pipeline business. But Enron has been steadily selling off its old-
economy iron and steel assets and expanding into new areas. In 2000,
95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its operating profits came
from ""wholesale energy operations and services."" This business, which
Enron pioneered, is usually described in vague, grandiose terms like
the ""financialization of energy""--but also, more simply, as ""buying
and selling gas and electricity."" In fact, Enron's view is that it
can create a market for just about anything; as if to underscore that
point, the company announced last year that it would begin trading
excess broadband capacity.

   But describing what Enron does isn't easy, because what it does is
mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a ""logistics
company"" that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity
and figures out the most cost-effective way to transport that
commodity to its destination. Enron also uses derivatives, like
swaps, options, and forwards, to create contracts for third parties
and to hedge its exposure to credit risks and other variables. If you
thought Enron was just an energy company, have a look at its SEC
filings. In its 1999 annual report the company wrote that ""the use of
financial instruments by Enron's businesses may expose Enron to
market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity
and equity prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates.""

   Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating. ""It's very difficult
for us on Wall Street with as little information as we have,"" says
Fleischer, who is a big bull. (The same is true for Enron's
competitors, but ""wholesale operations"" are usually a smaller part of
their business, and they trade at far lower multiples.) ""Enron is a
big black box,"" gripes another analyst. Without having access to each
and every one of Enron's contracts and its minute-by-minute
activities, there isn't any way to independently answer critical
questions about the company. For instance, many Wall Streeters
believe that the current volatility in gas and power markets is
boosting Enron's profits, but there is no way to know for sure. ""The
ability to develop a somewhat predictable model of this business for
the future is mostly an exercise in futility,"" wrote Bear Stearns
analyst Robert Winters in a recent report.

   To some observers, Enron resembles a Wall Street firm. Indeed,
people commonly refer to the company as ""the Goldman Sachs of energy
trading."" That's meant as a compliment. But the fact that part of
Goldman's business is inherently risky and impenetrable to outsiders
is precisely the reason that Goldman, despite its powerful franchise,
trades at 17 times trailing earnings--or less than one-third of
Enron's P/E. And as Long Term Capital taught us, the best-laid
hedges, even those designed by geniuses, can go disastrously wrong.
""Trying to get a good grip on Enron's risk profile is challenging,""
says Shipman.

   Nor at the moment is Enron's profitability close to that of
brokerages (which, in fairness, do tend to be more leveraged). While
Wall Street firms routinely earn north of 20% returns on their equity-
-Goldman's ROE last year was 27%--Enron's rate for the 12 months
ended in September (the last period for which balance sheet
information is available) was 13%. Even less appealing is Enron's
return on invested capital (a measure including debt), which is
around 7%. That's about the same rate of return you get on far less
risky U.S. Treasuries.

   Enron vehemently disagrees with any characterization of its
business as black box-like. It also dismisses any comparison to a
securities firm. ""We are not a trading company,"" CFO Andrew Fastow
emphatically declares. In Enron's view, its core business--where the
company says it makes most of its money--is delivering a physical
commodity, something a Goldman Sachs doesn't do. And unlike a trading
firm, which thrives when prices are going wild, Enron says that
volatility has no effect on its profits--other than to increase
customers, who flock to the company in turbulent times. Both
Skilling, who describes Enron's wholesale business as ""very simple to
model,"" and Fastow note that the growth in Enron's profitability
tracks the growth in its volumes almost perfectly. ""People who raise
questions are people who have not gone through [our business] in
detail and who want to throw rocks at us,"" says Skilling. Indeed,
Enron dismisses criticism as ignorance or as sour grapes on the part
of analysts who failed to win its investment-banking business. The
company also blames short-sellers for talking down Enron. As for the
details about how it makes money, Enron says that's proprietary
information, sort of like Coca-Cola's secret formula. Fastow, who
points out that Enron has 1,217 trading ""books"" for different
commodities, says, ""We don't want anyone to know what's on those
books. We don't want to tell anyone where we're making money.""

   In addition to its commodities business, Enron has another
division called Assets and Investments that is every bit as
mysterious. This business involves building power plants around the
world, operating them, selling off pieces of them, ""invest[ing] in
debt and equity securities of energy and communications-related
business,"" as Enron's filings note, and other things.

   Actually, analysts don't seem to have a clue what's in Assets and
Investments or, more to the point, what sort of earnings it will
generate. Enron's results from that part of its business tend to be
quite volatile--profits fell from $325 million in the second quarter
of 1999 to $55 million in the second quarter of 2000. In written
reports, Morgan Stanley chalked up the decline to the poor
performance of Enron's ""significant number of investments"" in telecom
stocks; Dain Rauscher Wessels blamed it on a lack of asset sales.

   In any event, some analysts seem to like the fact that Enron has
some discretion over the results it reports in this area. In a
footnote to its 1999 financials, Enron notes that it booked ""pretax
gains from sales of merchant assets and investments totaling $756
million, $628 million, and $136 million"" in 1999, 1998, and 1997.
""This is an enormous earnings vehicle, which can often be called upon
when and if market conditions require,"" notes UBS Warburg analyst Ron
Barone. Not everyone is so chipper. ""We are concerned they are
liquidating their asset base and booking it as recurring revenue,
especially in Latin America,"" says analyst Andre Meade at Commerzbank-
-who has a hold rating on the stock. At the least, these sorts of
hard-to-predict earnings are usually assigned a lower multiple.

   There are other concerns: Despite the fact that Enron has been
talking about reducing its debt, in the first nine months of 2000 its
debt went up substantially. During this period, Enron issued a net
$3.9 billion in debt, bringing its total debt up to a net $13 billion
at the end of September and its debt-to-capital ratio up to 50%, vs.
39% at the end of 1999. Nor does Enron make life easy for those who
measure the health of a business by its cash flow from operations. In
1999 its cash flow from operations fell from $1.6 billion the
previous year to $1.2 billion. In the first nine months of 2000, the
company generated just $100 million in cash. (In fact, cash flow
would have been negative if not for the $410 million in tax breaks it
received from employees' exercising their options.)

   But Enron says that extrapolating from its financial statements is
misleading. The fact that Enron's cash flow this year was meager, at
least when compared with earnings, was partly a result of its
wholesale business. Accounting standards mandate that its assets and
liabilities from its wholesale business be ""marked to market""--
valued at their market price at a given moment in time. Changes in
the valuation are reported in earnings. But these earnings aren't
necessarily cash at the instant they are recorded. Skilling says that
Enron can convert these contracts to cash anytime it chooses by
""securitizing"" them, or selling them off to a financial institution.
Enron then receives a ""servicing fee,"" but Skilling says that all the
risks (for example, changes in the value of the assets and
liabilities) are then transferred to the buyer. That's why, he says,
Enron's cash flow will be up dramatically, while debt will be ""way
down, way down"" when the company publishes its full year-end results,
which are due out soon.

   That's good, because Enron will need plenty of cash to fund its
new, high-cost initiatives: namely, the high-cost buildout of its
broadband operations. In order to facilitate its plan to trade excess
bandwidth capacity, Enron is constructing its own network. This
requires big capital expenditures. So broadband had better be a good
business. Both Enron and some of the analysts who cover it think it
already is. Included in the $126 a share that Enron says it's worth
is $40 a share--or $35 billion--for broadband. Several of Enron's
analysts value broadband at $25 a share, or roughly $22 billion (and
congratulate themselves for being conservative). But $22 billion
seems like a high valuation for a business that reported $408 million
of revenues and $60 million of losses in 2000. Not all analysts are
so aggressive. ""Valuing the broadband business is an ""extremely
difficult, uncertain exercise at this point in time,"" notes Bear
Stearns' Winters, who thinks that broadband, while promising, is
worth some $5 a share today.

   Of course everything could go swimmingly. Enron has told analysts
that it plans to sell between $2 billion and $4 billion of assets
over the next 12 months. The bullish scenario for Enron is that the
proceeds from those sales will reduce debt, and as earnings from new
businesses kick in, the company's return on invested capital will
shoot upward. Along with broadband, Enron has ambitious plans to
create big businesses trading a huge number of other commodities,
from pulp and paper to data storage to advertising time and space.
Perhaps most promising is its Enron Energy Services business, which
manages all the energy needs of big commercial and industrial
companies. Skilling has told analysts that its new businesses will
generate a return on invested capital of about 25% over the long run.

   But all of these expectations are based on what Wolfe, the  J.P.
Morgan strategist, calls ""a little bit of the China syndrome""--in
other words, if you get x% of y enormous market, you'll get z in
revenues. For instance, Enron says the global market for broadband
and storage services will expand from $155 billion in 2001 to
somewhere around $383 billion in 2004. ""Even a modest market share
and thin margins provide excellent potential here,"" writes Ed
Tirello, a Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown senior power strategist. The
problem, as we know from innumerable failed dot-coms, is that the y
enormous market doesn't always materialize on schedule. And Enron
isn't leaving itself a lot of room for the normal wobbles and
glitches that happen in any developing business.

   In the end, it boils down to a question of faith. ""Enron is no
black box,"" says Goldman's Fleischer. ""That's like calling Michael
Jordan a black box just because you don't know what he's going to
score every quarter."" Then again, Jordan never had to promise to hit
a certain number of shots in order to please investors.

"USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.

07/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) 
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine 
Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the 
bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million 
for power already sold.
Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the 
announcement. 
As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that 
the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under 
the contracts, will be elevated to ""administrative priority status,"" a claim 
which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. 
Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed 
reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, 
Calpine said. 
The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy 
crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state 
with a series of rolling blackouts. 
Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual 
capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next 
five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's 
power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent 
more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated 
from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. 
""Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to 
ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these 
affordable and reliable energy resources,"" Calpine senior vice president 
James Macias said in a statement."

"FYI.  This is the bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts (recall 
that the argument to end DA by the Gov's finance folks, the bond folks, and 
Angelides, the Treasurer stems directly from this linkage).  

Though Hertzberg was initially a supporter, his legal consultant has been 
scared off by the Gov's people (i.e., to de-link would ""impair"" the 
contracts, triggering breach, liquidated damages and the end of Western 
Civilization as we know it).  The Senate ain't buying that line.

As a result, it's now a Senate play, but they need Republicans to get the 
2/3's necessary for passage, which ain't likely to be easy.  We urging Brulte 
to go along, but only  in exchange for deleting the ""no DA"" language in AB1X 
and for legislative language assuring that DA will continue.

Well, it's upon us again and that means X-Mas party.  

Joseph and I have begun (barely) to plan for this year's festivities.  But 
before we get to far along, tried and true democratic (small ""d"") principles 
call for a wee bit of polling.  

Because we're already in the middle of October we need your responses

out the window, and good ol' dictatorship takes over.  

Of course, it will be difficult to grant everyone's wishes, but all 
suggestions will be given great (and equal) weight.  Here are the questions:

Would you prefer just dinner, or dinner plus an activity?

Joseph and I are leaning toward dinner and an activity, but wanted to hear 
from other folks.  If yes, Joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas 
for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome.  Same 
goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may 
influence where we eat).  Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys.

Should we try to organize the event with the rest of the SF office (i.e., EES 
and ENA) or confine it to GA?
Should we expand to include Western GA or keep it to SFGA?
We choose for dates the 7th or 8th or 14th or 15th of December.  What's your 
preference.  Is there a day that just won't work?

Joseph, if I've missed anything, please tack on.

As discussed, we have two possible approaches:
1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to the effective date of this legislation.
We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the duration of the turmoil.
Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15.  Thus if the wording gets changed to ""who are taking delivery as of the effective date of this legislation"" we have failed.
Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.

2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.
Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.

Harry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery....
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.
The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.

Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:
IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR costs.
SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, would be subject to a surcharge.
I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the clause ""The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.""
Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the bond is paid off; or
Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]
Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001

If it is possible, we should advocate:
Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.

And we should get a legal interpretation of  ""The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.""  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.

P.S. do you know that edison at the FERC hearing said that it hedged $30MM

""gaming"" the system?  Inquiring minds want to know.  You may want to check in 
with Smutney when Edison made the statement.  There may be nothing to it, but 
it might be interesting to check into.  Is Edison one of those ""profiteers""

Dan Walters: 2% problems vex governor


(Published Sept. 14, 2000)
Two percent doesn't sound like much of anything, but California's economy is
just so big -- a trillion-plus dollars a year, measured by either output or
personal income -- that even a tiny share can mean many billions of dollars.
As it happens, Gov. Gray Davis finds himself in the middle of several
quasi-economic, quasi-political squabbles, each of which involves a couple
of percentage points of California's economy -- and the outcome of which may
affect his governorship.
One showdown occurred last week when the Air Resources Board, an arm of the
Davis administration, decided to stick with its policy of compelling the
auto industry to sharply increase sales of zero-emission cars. There are
about 2,000 electric-powered cars now on California's roads, and the ARB
wants that to increase tenfold and beyond, despite industry assertions that
battery technology isn't advanced enough. Californians lay out about $20
billion a year for a million new cars -- 2 percent of the state's personal
income stream. The ARB's decision could either create an entirely new
industry of nonpolluting cars, as advocates claim, or reduce the overall
supply of cars that can be legally sold and drive up Californians' costs, as
critics maintain. And Davis will get the credit or blame.
Although exact numbers are hard to obtain, it's likely that within a few
years, Californians will be spending another $20 billion a year to gamble,
mostly in casinos operated by Indian tribes, thanks to legislation signed by
Davis -- a major recipient of tribal political contributions. Cardroom
operators, who say they may be driven out of business by lavish new Indian
casinos, persuaded the Legislature to pass two bills that would allow them
to offer new card games, including a form of blackjack. But the tribes
oppose such expansion, obviously wanting to maintain what is rapidly
becoming a state-sanctioned monopoly on casino gambling, and Davis must
decide the bills' fate. Regardless of what he does, cardroom operators are
mulling a federal lawsuit alleging that the Indian monopoly on slot machines
violates federal law, which generally grants Indian casinos parity with
other forms of gambling.
The final 2-percent issue facing Davis poses the greatest peril to his
governorship: the huge run-up in electric utility costs in the wake of
deregulation. Utilities were paying about $20 billion a year for power
before the recent spike, but their costs now have doubled. San Diego
ratepayers got hit first, but those in other major metropolitan areas could
feel the pocketbook pain soon.
Davis signed two measures, one that rolls back San Diegans' power bills
temporarily, but could lead to balloon payments later, and another to speed
up siting of new power plants. But they are, at best, stop-gap measures, and
he may veto a third bill that would have the state directly underwrite the
higher utility bills. What the governor appears to be doing, by word and
deed, is to plead with the Public Utilities Commission and the Energy
Commission to get him off the hook.
The timing is critical because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison say they are absorbing billions of dollars in higher
wholesale costs that they can't immediately pass on to consumers thanks to a
rate freeze. The freeze is supposed to end in 2002, just as Davis is seeking
a second term, and if he and his utility regulators can't come up with a
solution by then, all hell could break loose as consumers' bills escalate
sharply and they look for someone to blame.
Davis may not have had anything to do with the original deregulation
legislation -- as he points out at every opportunity -- but he's stuck with
the problem now. Dealing with it could be critical to his political future.

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  ""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind,"" he said. ""The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators.""

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a ""blind pig could
make money"" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  ""It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it,"" Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP ""an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers.""

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

The new Assembly Committee on Energy Costs and Availability.(ECA) met today
and heard two bills: ABX 5 (Keeley), relating to the ISO and PX governing
boards, and ABX 6 (Dutra/Pescetti), relating to utility retention of assets=
.
Both measures passed with only one dissenting vote on ABX 6 (Asm. John
Campbell).

Although ABX 5 passed in its current form, possible amendments to be taken
in the Senate would include:  increasing the number of governing board
members, increasing the length of the terms, and addressing the issue of
Governor appointees on the EOB confirming Governor appointees on the ISO an=
d
PX.  Testifying in support of the measure were the Consumers Union, EOB,
CalPIRG, TURN, ORA and the California Utilities Employees.  The ISO
testified in opposition based on a past FERC letter which opposes an
appointed Board.

The ABX 6 debate was over the conflict in the Public Utilities Code
regarding utility asset retention (Sections 851 and 377).   The debate,
however, was not limited to this one point.  Asm. Leonard started the ball
rolling when he noted a problem when some generation in the state is
regulated (the utility generation) and some isn=01,t (the new generators).
This issue was picked up by Asms. Steinberg, Jackson, Oropeza, and Diaz, wh=
o
suggested that there may need to be legislation to regulate all the
generation in the state.  Asm. Wright did a good job pointing out that in
doing so, the state would have to offer generator owners something in retur=
n
the state isn=01,t able to afford.

When Loretta Lynch spoke in support of the bill she began with the Stage 3
alert, noting there was 15,000 megawatts off-line today and generators were
refusing to allow state inspectors into their plants.  Although the only
company she named was AES, she made every committee member believe it was
everyone.  In response to a question about long-term contracts, she said
that since August this CPUC has allowed it and the utilities are the ones
who refuse to enter into contracts.

Pete Conaty from labor repeated his statement that when the new generators
purchased these plants, they significantly reduced the labor force, ran the
plants harder than when the utilities ran them and that is why the plants
are breaking down.

Both measures will be debated on the Assembly floor next when they go into
session tomorrow morning.

"Mark asked me to get your input regarding a Canadian form question.  We have 
the following language in the Canadian ISDA Agreements:

Limitation of Rate.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained 
in this Agreement, in no event shall the Default Rate, Non-default Rate, or 
Termination Rate exceed the maximum non-usurious interest rate, if any, that 
at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, taken, reserved, 
charged, or received on the subject indebtedness under the law applicable to 
such party.   For the purpose of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act 
(Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable 
under this Agreement that is calculated on any basis other than a full 
calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a 
fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar 
year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the 
denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis. 

Do we need to have the highlighted language exactly as it is, or can we have 
a general statement to the effect that the interest rate shall not exceed the 
maximun non-usurious rate and interest shall be paid on the actual number of 
days elapsed, based on a 365/366 day year?  Is there some special magic to 
the above highlighted language?

Thanks for your help."

OK, guys, based on Adnan's information from the counterparty, all contracts 
under Northern Illinois Gas Company will be changed (via name overlay) to 
Nicor Gas Company once Adnan has received the proper name change 
documentation.   Since no changes have been made in GCP to correct the HQ 
company and trade name relationships, the recent ISDA contract was set up 
under Nicor Gas Company.  Once these changes are made in GCP, the contract 
can be changed to the trade name if still needed at that time.

I apologize for all the confusion and hope this helps all parties concerned.

Thanks,
Stacey



Adnan Patel@ENRON on 08/17/2000 04:20:24 PM


Per my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas 
Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company 
is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the 
attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name ""Northern Illinois 
Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company"" eversince the name change happened. He 
said they had been using both names ""contractually"" and interchangeably even 
though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.

I'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks 
like thats going to happen:
The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the 
trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we 
could have a Tradename set up as ""Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor 
Gas Company"" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.

Nicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further 
clarifications in this matter.

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.

"This link should get you access to our Financial Trading, or ""Master Swap 
Agreement"" database.  This database lists all the master swap agreements we 
have in place or have drafted in the US, London, Singapore, Japan, South 
America, etc..  It is a very good resource to use when preparing 
confirmations.  This database is available to all Enron employees, so feel 
free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it 
helpful.  There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under 
negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of 
legal-client confidentiality concerns.  Any member of your legal team should 
be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close 
negotiation on a master, or if a master is being amended, what the amendments 
might address (sometimes helpful when Houston isn't at work yet!).  
Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company, 
so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a 
specific finance project or product (unusual, but sometimes).  Also, as I 
mentioned, not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, so 
look to confirm what type of master we entered into.  If they are not ISDA 
Multi-Currency Masters, it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade 
under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation.

Please note:  there is a listing for ""Restrictions"" which will reflect any 
trading limitations such as ""crude oil trades only"", ""no trades over 2 
years"", contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading 
limitations.  Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain 
critical trading guidance.  Another note to watch out for is that many US 
based master may have Texas law instead of NY.  Certainly not UK law.  We 
hope to have that information available in the database in the future.

If for some reason you can't access this database, let me know and we'll get 
our respective computer people to figure out why.

As I mentioned, I am a paralegal in the Houston swap group and am happy to 
answer any questions about particular masters, so please do not hesitate to 
call me at x33399.

Frank:
I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns 
with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add 
language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is 
considered to be ""signed"" and ""in writing"" if they are required by the 
Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a 
Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a 
GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers 
the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel 
better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I 
will let you know if it is acceptable.

Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a ""test"" run 
on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product 
description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana 
will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the 
ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time 
so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

Please call me if you have any questions.

I believe that this was authored by James Carville:


NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to
court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World
Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press
conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of the Major League
Players Union. ""We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,""
said the Mets batting coach.  ""We were confused by the irregularities of the
pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit.""

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the
press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of
the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the
Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. ""The fact remains that
some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit,"" said the 
Mets
batting coach. ""The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are
celebrating prematurely.""Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of
all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the
umpires of each game. ""While some of the strikes called against the Mets
were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of
the World Series,"" the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal
claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won
the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.

""It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees,"" said

a Mets spokesman.  ""The World Series crown is rightly ours.""The manager of
the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging
for exercise.  He has stated that he believes ""we need to let the process
run its course without a rush to judgment.""

All -

I'll be happy to do the legal due dliligence and ISDA documentation from here.

Bill/Cynthia:
Please let me know who in Credit will be handling this so that I can 
coordinate with them when the need arises.

Sara:
When Janice mentioned the legal due diligence with regard to commodity 
derivatives in the Philippines, did she mean the legal survey done by Allen & 
Overy?  If so , I've got copies of all that and can take it from here. If 
that isn't the case and you've done more ISDA work in the Phillipines since 
then, I'd be forever grateful if you could send over whatever copies of the 
stuff which you have for me to suss out the situation there.

Mark T. /Janice:
Is there any particular law firm whom we should work with this time round?

Thanks, all.

Well, it looks like we might have a shot at an ISDA w/ a PHilippines 
company.  One issue that discussed w/ Manuel but he does not mention in his 
note is that we would probably require an enforceability opinion from Petron 
(a compnay jointly owned by the PHilippines govt and Saudi Aramco).  I'm not 
sure which credit dept. would handle this deal, but Cynthia Schnedier has 
some familiarity w/ Petron.   I'll leave it to Mark, Alan and Anita to 
determine whether Anita will handle the ISDA or whether it will be someone 
from Houston (Sara S. did the original legal due diligence on the 
enforceability of commodities derivatives contracts in the PHilippines).

Manuel,

Thanks for the update and we look forward to meet Petron traders/risk 
management team during our next visit to Manila, probably during our first 
cargo of gasoil to FGH, currently planned for end August / early September. 
Kindly let us know on new developments. For your information, John is away on 
home leave and will be back in office only after mid - August.  

Best regards,
Eng









Dear John,

Yayette Ventigan of Petron informed me yesterday that the energy derivatives 
course conducted by Paradigm in Manila from July 7 to 10 was well-received.  
I sensed that the course was not deemed easy by the Petron participants.  
Further, Yayette indicated that they could have easily used up more time for 
the same amount of material.

Given the Paradigm course (and the Citibank course which Yayette attended in 
Australia), Yayette indicated that the Petron Board will most likely give the 
marching orders to Petron management on July 27 to (1) develop an initial, 
basic and conservative hedging program for Petron?s fuel oil and gasoil 
supplied to the National Power Corporation and (2) go out to the market (most 
likely through a bid process) and execute a financial risk management 
contract (ISDA).

Yayette indicated that Petron looks forward to the working meeting with 
Enron?s Singapore traders.  I indicated to Yayette that end of August to 
early September would probably be convenient for us.  Yayette could not yet 
determine an appropriate time for Petron.

With respect to legal expectations, Petron appears to be at ease with the
following:

?  In general, the concept of disassociating the financial risk management 
contract from the Philippines with the exception of Petron Corporation (a 
Philippine corporation) being a party to the contract.

?  Petron executing a financial risk management contract with an offshore 
counter-party like Citibank Australia or ECT Singapore.

?  Petron physically executing the contract outside the Philippines.

?  The contract to be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

I did point out to Yayette the need for offshore collateral in the form of a 
Letter of Credit, which is consistent with the risk of non-enforcement for 
collateral in the Philippines.  Yayette indicated that she would raise this 
issue in her discussions with Petron treasury.

More later as I receive more feedback from Petron.

Best regards,
Manuel













"
"All:

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING BASED UPON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES TO THIS 
PREPAY

(1)  The Toronto Dominion (Texas) master agreement with ECT is a restricted 
master.  It was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not 
necessarily market (or ENA) standard.  It should be reviewed immediately by 
legal and credit.

(2)  The Morgan Stanley Capital Group master agreement is very old.  IT IS 
NOT AN ISDA .  It is a 1992 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement (limited to 
simple transactions and commodities).  The terminology is not even ISDA 
terminology.  This master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for 
upgrading to an ISDA.  

Rod:  You need to take a look at the Toronto Dominion (Texas) master 
agreement now and we should discuss.

Treasa:  Will there be a rate swap?  Under which master(s)?

"
"Ed:  I need to understand factually what is happening.  All transactions 
between ENA and Mirant Americas Energy Marketing should be subject to the 
existing ISDA between ERMS and Vastar Gas Marketing Inc., as amended.  The 
existing guaranty from Vastar Resources, Inc. applies to all trades through 
approximately  the end of this week

Who have you spoken with at Mirant as a follow up to our conversation of last 
Friday?  It appears that Mirant is trying to prevent trading until the new 
guaranty is in place.  Frank has contacted Mirant legal and are in agreement 
in principle as to the new guaranty from Mirant Corporation.  However, we 
understand that this entity  will be spun off in the near future and the 
credit could change substantially.  Have you given thought to the effect of 
the new guaranty?

Also, have we traded today with Mirant Americas Energy Marketing?  Online or 
offline?  We should talk to our traders about apparent authority and/or save 
tapes if we are having problem

Call.

We will negotiate a new ISDA in the next few months

It was my understanding that they would not be able to opt out of trading 
under the ISDA, since this contract has not been terminated.  However, if 
this is not the case and the trades that we are currently entering into are 
not being confirmed under the ISDA, I think that we should get together as 
soon as possible.  We do a significant volume of trades each day with this 
counterparty both OTC and EOL.

Lets discuss.

Ed Sacks
  

 
Importance: High

Ed - After we hung up, I though a bit more about trading with Mirant.  In 
light of the letter sent by Mirant on February 26 that stated "". . . no 
further transactions will be enter into under the agreement"", we need to call 
Mirant prior to completing the trade.  I will try on this end, but you should 
also try.  The contact is Nicole Russell (678) 579-7489.

I have recieved everything.  I'll send copies of the TD & RBC signatures as 
soon as I recieve them.  The Risk Management deal you signed is, in effect, 
the Confirm between ENA and ECC.  For tax purposes, ENA does not deal 
directly with ECC, so the Risk Management vehicle takes the place of ENA.  

Thanks,

I believe that, as you requested, I have now had executed and returned to you 
by fax copies of the commodity swaps between Enron Canada and each of RBC, TD 
Bank and Risk Management as well as the two rate swaps between Enron Canada 
and each of RBC and TD.  I believe the only other confirm requiring Enron 
Canada's execution in this transaction is the back-to-back rate swap between 
Enron Canada and ENA, whereby Enron Canada swaps the floating rate for the 
fixed rate with ENA.  You can send that confirm directly to my attention by 
e-mail and I will get it signed and sent back to you.  I understand that you 
will be attending to obtaining counterparty execution of these confirms.  
Could you do me a favor and, when you receive the fully executed confirms 
back from the respective counterparties, fax fully executed copies of all the 
confirms to my attention at 403-974-6707.  I am aggregating copies of all the 
documents relating to this financing for our files and will need the executed 
confirms as part of that process.

Friends,
Greetings from India.  Just a brief update to let you all know what is
happening.  This week I finished a 3 week teaching course on the Book of
Romans, with 8 students from one of the schools in Kodai.  I think that is
the most exciting thing I have ever done in my life.  I asked the students
one day who lead them to Christ.  Everyone single one of them have been
saved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing in
their school over the last year.  But what was even more exciting than that
was the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family.  All of the
others were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family.
That young man's name is Anifa.  He came to Christ through one of the
pograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown so
much, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion to
Christ.  Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord.  Anifa
will honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole school
knows that he is a man of prayer.  Recently Anifa asked me if I would teach
him how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go back
and reach his people for Jesus.
Until Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated,
because I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won a
single Muslim to Christ.  Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because I
have won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others.
Please be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates,
and a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler.
They will be coming in June and July.  We will be starting 2 new Churches,
and ministering in the schools.
And please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that was
started last summer by the team from Southwestern.
I look forward to seeing you all this year.  Angela and I are praying about
God's direction for our future.  Please pray with us that for God's guidance
as we plan for our future together.  God bless.

Chad Germany

price deal and it goes through September.  The volume is 5,000 per month for 
April through August and 20,000 per month for September.

CES sold the physical gas back to ENA.  The only gas CES has are the Exhibit

dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 08/03/2000 06:57:54 AM



Chris--There is a recurring set of monthly transactions on ENA's invoices that
I don't recognize.  Perhaps you can help me understand what they are.   In 
each
case, CES is invoiced for purchasing approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Dth/month at

SA-226553.  Then, this same monthly volume is re-purchased by ENA at a fixed
price.  The Sitara # for the ""buy-back"" is SA-227738.

Do these transactions have something to do with the physical gas that we have
purchased from ENA for our retail customer retention activities?

I bought 15,000/d at the TCO Pool from Dick J at $6.895 for 12/2 through 
12/31. At first he was concerned we were swinging on ENA and not storage and 
I assured him you folks knew what volume we buy/sell @ GD as soon as you get 
my nom. I have even included my estimate on the bottom of my daily nom sheet.

A few more questions --
What about for the Central Desk volumes?  Who is going to estimate those ??  
Who is going to compare March noms with the booked volume on Exhibit ?
Who is going to physically be the one to enter the deals in Sitara / TAGG, 
both for Central and East for the remaining term April 2000 through March 
2001???
When will it go into the books ??

I discussed CES retail with Chris. He is going to work with Dick on 
estimating a good retail volume to book.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES.  

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
advise.

The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January, on behalf 
of Transredes, has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates 
will go into effect towards the end of this month.  The rates are not much 
lower than what we filed for, and represent a very significant increase over 
the previous rates.  The tariff methodology and revised regulations, put into 
effect by the Supreme Decree, were followed to the letter by the regulator 
despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down.  The deliverables 
here were to (1) obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would 
make the company finance-able / rescue it from dire financial straits and (2) 
file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the 
tariff methodology.  This second deliverable has now been completed.  
Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the 
uncertainty about rates; it is my understanding that the financial market 
loved the ruling and that Transredes sold $40 million worth of bonds in about 
5 minutes!  This ruling should also significantly increase Transredes's 
market value, relative to Enron's efforts to sell its interest in the company.

Gentlemen,

I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TR's 
tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation.  The details are :-

     Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved % Increase TR/CLHB Proposed TR/CLHB % 
Increase

Gas Export (including surcharges)  $0.18  $0.2205  22.5%  $0.26 (excluding 
RG)  44.4%
Liquids Domestic    $1.05  $2.46  134.3%  $3.25    209.5%
Liquids Export     $1.55  $2.31  49%  $3.35    116.1%

CLHB's tariffs were also approved as follows $1.19  $2.20  84.9%  $3.528    
196.5%

As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB (comparable with our 
liquids domestic) !!

We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach 
their conclusions on Monday, but our inteligence suggests the following :-

1. Export gas volumes increased to 100% TR capacity, and 100% GSA + Cuiaba 2 
assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes
2. RG Compresion project deleted
3. Interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 % i.e. the rate in our bond issue
4. Liquids expansion in the South reduced
5. Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced
6. Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between 
concesions
7. OCC in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004.
8. Debt/Equity assumption changed from 60/40 to 70/30

Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows :-

1. Volumes.  Covered by 8% rule, we can blete but can expect little back 
here.  Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the 
short term i.e. 2002/2003.
2. RG Compression - not worth fighting for since we don't even have the 
support of BG
3. Interest Rate - We'll get this back when we do a tariff  revision and 
actual rates are used.  When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we 
have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited.
4. Liquids Expansion in the South.  Here we intend to do a detailed analysis 
of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids/gas production 
will be shut in.  If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected 
producers (PB, BG, Vintage and Chaco).  We will then write to those 
producers(copy SIRESE , VMEH etc.) stating that on their recommendation the 
project scope was reduced by SIRESE.  We will give them an estimate of the 
lost liquids/gas production (in both volume and cash terms) resultant from 
this decision.  We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions 
we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal.
5. Continuity of Service Capex.  We need to see the detail here.  We will 
take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared 
to compromise our safety and environmental standards.  We need to see exactly 
what has been removed, but my thought is that if that means we are unable to 
provide some services (e.g. LPG transportation) or the continued operation of 
some liquids laterals, we should write to those producers affected suggesting 
that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the 
decision.  Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff 
revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the 
SIRESE budget process.
6. OPEX - need to see the detail on Monday.
7. OCC - will not appeal - we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC 
strategy.
8. Debt/Equity ratio.  Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance 
with the Law/Regulation - the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 
40%.  However, we have very strong grounds to appeal since : a) we are 
currently miles away from 60/40 let alone 70/30, b) we can only borrow for 
CAPEX (as per bond issue and the policy of all/most banks/lending 
institutions) with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 
100% of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 
60/40.  We intend to fight this one very hard using all the 
external/independant help we can get.

As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much 
needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we 
would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut.  This has not happened 
SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases.  Having 
got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above 
strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much 
smaller and hence managable increases.

Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above 
points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume 
assumptions (i.e. the worst case).

Regards,
Doug

Hello Steve,  I hope you and your family had a great holiday.  Steve, I heard 
on a talk show that the Bush Energy Policy would tackle such topics as 
Alaskan Gas, ANWR and also would mention the Powder River coal bed methane 
play.  I would like to get a copy of the Energy Policy when it becomes 
available.   I would also like everyone to be aware of the large investments 
made and planned by Northern Border Partners in the Powder River and Wind 
River Basins of Wyoming.  In addition, the Denver office of Enron North 
America has a large stake in gas trading in the Rockies.   Everything 
considered, the development of Rocky Mountain gas reserves, including the 
gathering and pipeline infrastructure will be less controversial than ANWR 
and will get gas to markets much sooner.  For example, Northern Border 
Partners expects to file at the FERC by the 3rd quarter of 2001 for the Bison 
Pipeline project which will connect Powder River reserves to NBPL in 2003 
(versus 2007 for Alaskan gas).  You can see the latest on the Bison project 
at Inside FERC, December 18th page 5.

One pending federal action that would do much to enhance coal bed methane 
production, is the completion of an EIS  presently being prepared by the 
BLM.   The timely issuance of a favorable EIS would open thousands of federal 
acres in Wyoming and Montana to drilling by coal bed methane producers and 
would assist gas in getting to market within Bush's first term in office.    
I hope Enron and the new administration can set Powder River gas as a 
priority item in the coming year !"

Dear Mr. Kean:

My team is pulling together the briefing books for our upcoming Highlands
Forum meeting in Carmel Valley.  These books include a list of short
biographies.  Your biography, provided to me by Dick O'Neill, currently
reads as follows:

""Mr. Steven J. Kean is Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff for Enron
Corporation.  Mr. Kean's responsibilities include government affairs, public
relations, corporate communications, advertising, and administration.  Mr.
Kean also serves on the Executive Committee of Enron.  Mr. Kean has a B.A.
from Iowa State University and a J.D. from the University of Iowa.""

I wanted to provide you with the opportunity to send a slightly longer
biography, if you so desire.  The general length of our biographies is
usually roughly 15-20 lines.  If I do not hear from you, I will assume that
the above entry is fine.

We look forward to seeing you in Carmel Valley!

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Assembly Bill No. 128 (""AB 
128X"").  The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (increased cost to 
purchasers) and constitutional deficiencies of AB 128X.

The third paragraph of the Tax Review details the mathematical computation of 
the tax and the resulting purchaser price increase.  The computation sales 
price, $300/MWh, reflects the SP15 (Southern California) weighted average 
index price ($302.88), rounded to the nearest hundred, as reported in 
Megawatt Daily's May 8th MarketReport.  However, it may be more effective to 
present the mathematical computation with a price closer to the proposed base 
price of $60/MWh.  We are available to assist in presenting the computation 
utilizing whichever numbers you deem appropriate.

Steve,

As you might have expected, Elsa already had a to do list, a budget, 
information on schools, etc.  I really did not have to discuss about moving 
to Houston.  The conversation was more around when and how.

On Friday I have to be in Houston for an EBS meeting on Mexico.  I am 
planning to arrive there on Thursday morning to talk to Rick, to Dan Reck and 
to Shawn Cumberland.  I also need to find out about relocation and visas , 
etc.

I am writing you to thank you for your generosity in your advice and for 
helping me and encouraging me in making this important decision.  I am also 
wirting because I am taking your word on Melissa's  knowledge of the real 
estate market inside the loop.  Elsa is coming with me on Thursday morning 
and we would like to see if it is possible for us to meet with Melissa on 
Thursday, Friday or Saturday for advice and orientation. (Of course you would 
be welcome to the real estate working session!!)

Please let me know.

Thanks again,

Ricardo

"Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must 
make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak 
demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with 
porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are 
working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The 
problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply 
enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated 
market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than 
prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and 
Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in 
California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the 
market.

Mark,

Here's my shot.  I did it in Revision mode so you can see the changes.  Note 
that Enron never got out of the retail market in CA and has gathered about 
1,000 MW of retail load -- we're bigger than all but two of the municipal 
utilities in the state.  Enron stopped marketing to residential consumers -- 
that's what all the  fuss was about in 1997.  Anyone else feel free to take 
your own shot.

Some of our people get asked on the phone about what is going on in 
California.  I have drafted the attached paper for their use.  It is intended 
to be simple and user-friendly.  Your thoughts on whether I achieved that 
objectvie are welcome.  More importantly, I need you to confimr that I got 
the story and facts correct, and that I have not said anything about the 
situation that you (Enron USA) would not want to say, or have not said, or if 
we have said something fundamentally different, I need to know that, too.

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)=20
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices,=20
generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state=
=20
was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=
ge=20
1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the fir=
st=20
time since they went into effect June 21.=20
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the=
=20
table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=
=20
uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy=
=20

the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=

""They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=
n=20
over the FERC order,"" Hidalgo said. ""We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear.""=20
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced=20
California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said.=20
Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a=20
variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power=
=20
market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiti=
ng=20
profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.=
=20
And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap=
=20
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20
""That's the risk that you run (with price controls),"" said Arthur O'Donnell=
,=20
editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. ""People want any kind o=
f=20
certainty at all.""=20
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=
s=20
from the Bonne=0F'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that marke=
ts=20
government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state=
=20
went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts ar=
e=20
ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The=20
price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient=
=20
plant operating in California during a ""power alert"" declared by the=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid=
.=20
When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was=
=20
established during the latest alert.=20
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=
n=20
California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early=20
afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7=20
percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many=20
California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew=
=20
by how much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=
98=20
in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent=20
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=
it=20
risk in selling to the state.=20
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every=
=20
time the ISO declares a power alert.=20
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=

out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the=20

As discussed in last Friday's meeting on strategies related to higher energy 
prices, Harry asked me to develop the attached projection of delivered gas 
prices for this winter.

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices 
for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states 
(Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating 
season (Nov-Mar).  Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the 
delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead 
prices for the 2000-2001 winter period.  A national projection is also 
included.

Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a 
smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial 
customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced 
than for commercial or industrial customers.  In addition, LDC purchased gas 
cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent 
because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 
months in some cases).  Furthermore, some state public utility commissions 
(e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for 
ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco 
recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this 
winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).

If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have 
comments with respect to the above let me know.

The Senate voted on the Interior Appropriations Bill late yesterday.  Our 
amendment passed, which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from 
enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies.  The BLM made 
a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate, but we had reached key 
Senators and staff and they got nowhere.

Action now moves to Conference, which for us means a focus on the House 
Conference members.  Scott and I will spend the next 2 days meeting with the 
key Republicans in the House.  We've already recruited the important 
Democrats.  Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed, at 
least publicly, but we think we can get other Members to swing him.  We trust 
he'll come up with a sensible, face saving compromise on his own, eg, 
formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight -- 
at this point, our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even 
meeting to discuss the issue.

We continue, though, on several other fronts:

1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and 
Congressmen writing BLM and USFS
2. We've increased the pressure on the White House, and are letting them know 
through very senior back door channels that in our opinion, BLM/Forest 
Service have not gotten the message.  Our position is that we'll be satisfied 
that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood 
EBS build is retracted.
3. We're preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the 
longer-term issue next session.  We have no trouble finding champtions eager 
to own the issue
4. We're engaging the Western Caucus for same
5. Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over 20 
companies and associations now actively engaged.  Enron chairs this 
initiative, with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and 
stature as a serious communications player.
6. Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from 
the end-user perspective

BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting, which we've refused.   We 
don't think they've given up though, and it's likely an issue of pride at 
this point.  So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the 
full court press.

"I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been

but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of 
the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting 
to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless 
e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, 
but that's what makes everyday interesting.

Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice - 
saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to 
satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big 
holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no 
apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop 
hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in 
(or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard.

Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to 
remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people 
who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I 
heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad? 
Or ugly?

Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 22nd, 
and it will be so nice to see the sun again. If I don't see you, have a great 
vacation, and try not to be overwhelmed by the joyousness of the season.

a note in the comments section regarding the zero price and ""no confirm"" 
status? The Confirms group in Houston has requested some kind of comment in 
these deals so they don't try to track down a price or confirm the deal.

Here's what's wierd:  I ran a Sales Volume Report for 2/21 only, and got a 
total of  596,284.

On your report for the same day,  I get a total of 1,468,175.  That doesn't 
include anything done by about 4 books that are supposed to be on mine!

I wonder what's up with that??  I just wrote to Duong luu to ask him about 
the sales volume report.  






   Kate Symes                02/22/2001 12:02 PM



I create a report each afternoon that tracks total volume done by each desk 
through EOL and brokered deals. I've attached last night's report for you to 
look over - if this looks like something you'd like to receive, let me know 
and I'll add you to the mailing list. 

And in regard to the dow jones file, I've just finished entering deals for 
Friday and Saturday, so my afternoon will be devoted to creating that. I'll 
let you know as soon as it's done.

"Here is the information I received back from IT in Houston regarding the 
Forward Obligation Report. It looks like, for our purposes, the most accurate 
way to run the report is showing only term deals. The ""Schedule"" and 
""Liquidate"" versions of the report do not capture desk-to-desk deals, and 
therefore will not show our traders' positions in relation to each other, 
which I believe is what we're looking for. Am I right? Or totally crazy? Let 
me know what you think.

Thanks,
Kate





    Hi Diana & Kate,


    You are not wasting our time, you make our time valuable. You should be 
able to see ver 3.0.0.36 in production and ver 3.0.0.38 in stage,
    if not phone David Poston for support. Ver 3.0.0.38 is newer and includes 
insignifficant changes on the form for selection desks, which
    Corry Bentley requested here. They don't allow us to promote now things 
like that to production the last five days and the first day of the month.

   Now the report is able to show both the term and schedule (liquidation) 
data. The term data are the way the deal was entered with
   Deal Entry, Deal Blotter or EOL bridge, signed and confirmed. The schedule 
data should be very much the same with all the changes
   in Deal Scheduling. There is no difference between schedule and 
liquidation data, schedule data is a subset of liquidation one in time and
   it is about 2-3 weeks. At the moment the schedule strips for WEST contain 
data from 3/22/2001 to 4/5/2001, and the liquidation
   the same data from 4/2/1996. 

   Because we don't schedule normally desk-to-desk deals (I think we schedule 
between EAST and WEST only) we don't have schedule
   (liquidation) data for desk-to-desk. I hided the check box to avoid 
confusions. The option Show Desk is very simple, changes the format
   of the header for Region, nothing else.

   Kroum





 

Kroum,

I was running the new version of the Obligation Report.  I was not included 
in the testing phase of the new version and apparently the report is still 
not doing what the ""fix"" was initiated for.  Originally, my discussions with 
Doung Luu was for the Obligation report to capture: 1. All deals with any 
changes made in Deal Scheduling and  2.  All Desk to Desk deals.  Number 
(2),   I believe was the difficult one.  When selecting the option on ""Show 
Deals""  in order to capture schedule changes you must select ""Liquidate"".  
This does work, but it does not give you the option to select ""Show Desk to 
Desk"", which like I said before, was the intent of the changes.  Please 
contact me for further discussion.  I apologize for not participating and 
wasting your time.  

Sincerely,

Diana Scholtes

Good afternoon, IT Wizards -

I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now 
possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In 
the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my 
desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed 
to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the 
difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. 
Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a 
chance.

Thanks,

   Kate Symes @ ECT                05/02/2001 10:56 AM



I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as 
peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them 
incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak 
and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds!

Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades 
as they are.

Thanks,
Kate



Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON
05/02/2001 08:59 AM



That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and 
we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you 
double check with Bob for accuracy.

Evelyn




   Kate Symes @ ECT                05/02/2001 10:43 AM



Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

OK Gang,
Time to select (and pay) for 2001 tickets.
What I have is:
Gary Lamphier  25 games
Greg Brazaitis  20 games
Jason Mathew  10 games $340
Stacey Neuweiler 10 games $340
Eric Bass     5 games $170
Elsa V      5  games $170
Danny Conner     5  games $170

Jim Homco has two seats next to us and is hoping to trade so any of us can 
have 4 seats to a game and he can then have 4 seats to a game.
We need to draft this week.  I will set the rotation by number of tickets 
purchased to start the rotation then random draw.  In other words I will pick 
1st, Greg 2nd,
Stacey & Jason 3rd & 4th ( I will flip a coin that day) and Eric , Elsa and 
Danny to follow ( we will draw an order that day).  
So in summary there are 16  packages of 5 games; so every 16 games I will get 
5, Greg 4, Jason  and Stacey 2, and the other 3 one.
So round 1 would look like this:

 1) Gary
 2) Greg
 3) Jason/Stacey
 4) Jason/Stacey
 Picks 5-16 will then be pulled out of a hat to determine order for all 
remaining picks with Gary's name 4 times, Greg 3 times, and every one else 
once.
We need to do this this week.  How about Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday from 
11:00 - 1:00 (we should finish earlier).  The schedule is at astros.mlb.com 
or I will bring hard copies for you.

Please respond today of any date that does not work.

[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]

Two local men were seriously injured when their pickup truck left the road
and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday
morning.

Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after
midnight Monday.

Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are
listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred
as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip.

On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned.
The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had
burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the
.22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to
the steering wheel column.

After inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly
and the two men proceeded toward the White River bridge. After traveling
about 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently
overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle
swerved sharply right exiting the pavement and striking a tree.

Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken
clavicle and was treated and released.

""Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or we
might both be dead"" stated Wallis.

""I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a
first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident
happened,"" said Snyder.

Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogs
the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.
Way to go, Lavinia)

Sally,

Following our Doorstep meeting today, I am following up on your request that 
I forward to you the list of Portland transactions for which we still require 
documentation, e.g. invoices, SAP entries, etc.  For the Settlements testing 
only, we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly-selected 
transactions, in order to facilitate the Settlement group's ability to 
complete both its monthly close obligations and our Doorstep request.  The 
deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green.




Also per your request, attached are the five ""non-standard"" deals for which 
we have been unable to obtain any information at all.  Our primary need is 
just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.

Colorado Springs Utilities  10/1/98-9/30/03 Colorado 50-150 MWs
BPA     10/1/01-12/31/05 NW Delivered 105 MWs
Welded Tube    1/1/98-6/30/05 PGE - NW 5.2-12MWs
British Columbia Power Exchange 1/1/98-1/1/15 COB 85-176 MWs
Harbor Cogen


Thank you for your help, Sally,

 Office of the Chairman



Please join us at an all-employee meeting at 10 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 3, in the 
Hyatt Regency's Imperial Ballroom. We will review our financial and operating 
highlights and discuss in more detail the strategy behind Enron Net Works and 
our wholesale marketing efforts.  The meeting will be streamed live on IP-TV 
to employees in Houston, Omaha, Portland, New York, Calgary, Toronto, London, 
Stockholm, Frankfurt and Amsterdam.  For the first time, we will broadcast 
the meeting via video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Rio de 
Janeiro, Buenos Aires and San Juan.  

As always, we welcome your questions and will answer any questions submitted 
in advance.  Please send them to Mary Clark by e-mail, fax (713-853-6790) or 
interoffice mail (EB4704C).  The deadline for advance questions is Wed., 
Sept. 27.  Of course, we also welcome and will answer any questions raised at 
the meeting.

We look forward to seeing you there.

"Congratulations on your added role of CEO for Enron Europe.  I look forward 
to continuing to work with you and the staff in London on risk management 
operations initiatives.  

I talk with Brent Price several times a week.  I know that Fernley has 
appreciated his participation in London, and I hope that you have found his 
involvement to be beneficial as well.  We are almost at the half way mark on 
his assignment, so I will talk with you next week when I return from Calgary 
to get your input on his role to date.  "
"Congratulations to you and Lanettte on the birth of Nicole Mackenzie.  What a 
pretty name!  I was in London last week and got the news while I was there.  

I hope that everyone in your household is doing well, although I know that 
you are probably a bit sleep deprived.  That will pass - although with your 
first one that is really hard to believe.  Please stop by as soon as you have 
pictures.  I would love to see them.  --Sally "
"FYI

I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin 
interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be 
the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top 
MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR 
for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our 
recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners 
and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron 
Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview 
team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages 
during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  

 I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be 
the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia 
School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is 
a short one.  "
"I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday.  My dad is 
experiecing serious health problems, and he will be in Houston on Friday for 
an appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.  I will be going to 
the doctor's appointment with my dad.  Depending upon waiting room time, I 
may not be in the office for the 1:30 meeting in EB3305 to discuss the 
findings from the recent internal audit projects.  I have asked Shona Wilson 
to attend in my place.  Please continue with the meeting, as I know that this 
is a difficult meeting to schedule.  I will get an update from Shona when I 
get back to the office.  "
"Great idea -- hopefully we can make that happen.  These days with Mom and 
Dad, I have asked Patti to copy you, Cindy and them on my travel plans.  That 
way all of you will have numbers where I can be reached if something were to 
come up.  Hopefully, never needed!  

Have a great time in New York later this week.  I sent you a newspaper 
article in the mail today, that you may get before you leave.

"Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving 
to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for 
the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our 
weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for 
Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I 
can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York 
office.  

It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn 
could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London 
office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some 
feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very 
early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to 
Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well 
organized and control minded.  Understands Enron's business.  Managing a 
group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that 
people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are 
a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her 
based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  

Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.  
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would 
definitely represent an Enron point of view.  They have two small daughters - 
she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost 
that way.  

This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.  
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you 
could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally   "
"Count me in - I have really enjoyed doing this during the past two years.   I 
will review the 16 applications and will rank order the top eight for you by 
the end of this week.  For your planning purposes, I will be available to 
interview at UT during the week of March 26.  Best days for me are Tuesday, 
March 27 and Thursday, March 29.  I can make other days work as well.  For 
the luncheon during the week of April 16, I am available on April 16, 17, 18 
or 19th.  Hope this helps.  

If you do not have enough response from your list below, let me know and I 
will help put together a team to interview potential scholarship recepients 
on campus.  --Sally 





Memorandum

 Gene Humphrey
 Wanda Curry

 Christie Patrick
 Charlene Jackson

From: Karen Marshall, University Affairs
 

I want to thank each of you for your past participation in the selection 
process of the recipients of the UT Enron MBA Excellence Scholarships.  As 
you know, the Enron Endowed scholarships are part of a $3 million gift to the 
school  with $1 million earmarked to endow the Enron UT MBA excellence fund.  
Our scholarships are among the largest at the McCombs School of Business and 
it is important to seek the highest level of involvement for the selection of 
this prestigious award.  Because of your knowledge of the company, your  
judgement and your leadership ability, I am soliciting your help again in 
selecting the recipients of the 2001 scholarships.  

The school has submitted sixteen outstanding candidates for Enron's 
consideration and are confident that we are reviewing the very best out of 
over 100 first year MBA students who actually applied for our scholarships.  
It is now up to us to determine who the final 3 recipients of the $10,000 
scholarships will be.  We are seeking the best and brightest students who 
exemplify the vision, values and beliefs of Enron, regardless of commitment 
to a career in energy.   

In order to expedite the process, I am sending you  the package  with the 16 
applicants for your review.  I would like to get your feedback in rank order 
of the top 8 candidates no later than March 16th.  After we have narrowed the 
pool down  to the top 8 candidates, I will contact the students and arrange 
for a face to face interview in Austin with the Enron team members that are 
able to travel to UT  to make the final selection of the winners.

The school has a very tight deadline that we must comply with for the 
selection of candidates.   Below is a timeline of the process: 

March   6, 2001  - Send applications to Enron Team for review
March 16, 2001 -  Reply to Karen Marshall with the ranking of the top 8 
candidates based on the application
March 19,  2001 - Schedule interviews on campus with Enron team and 
scholarship applicants
March 26, 2001 -   Week of March 26 students are interviewed and winners 
selected
March 29, 2001 -   Announcement of Scholarship  Winners 
April 16, 2001    -  Week of April 16th, schedule a small intimate luncheon 
with Enron executive and the scholarship winners
Sept 10, 2001-      Week of Sept 10th, schedule Scholarship Award Dinner for 
winners and their family, the faculty, the Dean and the Enron team 

If your schedule does not allow you to participate in the selection process 
this year, please let me know immediately so that we don't miss the 
deadlines.  

Thank you in advance for your support.

Karen Marshall

"Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.  Since 
Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him 
in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain 
a mention of the transition:

Example:

 Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be 
transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce 
assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will 
report to Barry effective with his start date in May.  

I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out 
of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading 
operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.  So sounds as if that 
is clarified.  "
"Thanks for your message.  I thought that John did have responsibility for 
risk, and I am glad to have that clarified.   Kristin worked for me for 
several years as the risk lead for ENA power and joined Barry at EBS last 
August, so I knew that you all had a great resource there!  

I will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have 
potential solutions for EBS that can be borrowed or modified from EWS.  Just 
give me a call when you are ready to get back together.  --Sally 




Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today.  You gave me some valuable 
insights and suggestions.

I do want to correct one misstatement that I made.  John DOES have ownership 
of the risk books.  This area of responsibility is being handle by a lady 
named Kristen Albrecht who reports to Barry Pearce who is in charge of 
trading operations.

I am looking forward to meeting with you again soon.

In the severability language that you sent to me, one of the Sections that is

know covers governing law and jurisdiction.  In our Schedule, we typically

Tracy:

Kaiser is hopeful that an answer on this can come quickly as they would like 
to enter into the physical index deal as soon as tomorrow or Friday.

 

Carol,

West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical 
Corporation (""Kaiser Aluminum"") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap 
and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. (""Kaiser 
International"") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant 
forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International 
which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.

Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING 
AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?  
If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with 
Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward 
positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off 
of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need 
to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as 
well?

If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about 
the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts.  
Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter 
into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, 
and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June 
swap, then we'll try for a July swap.

Regards,
Tracy"
"Mark:
I need for you to send an e-mail to Michelle Word informing her of the 
following in connection with my leave that you have approved:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, I am planning on 
adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that I have for 
2000 which I believe is an additional 10-12 days.

2. After that time is used up, I plan to take an unpaid leave of absence.  
Michelle informs me that I have to specify a date and as you are aware I am 
not sure how long I will take but if I need to specify a date, let's just 
pick until December 31, 2000 and as you and I have discussed, I will keep you 
informed throughout my leave as to what my plans are once I decide.


3. Tentatively, I am planning for July 14th to be my last day but I should 
know more after next Wednesday.


Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

Carol

Just a few additional thoughts on this list as possible topics:

1.  credit event upon merger - seems like more counterparties want to define 
the ""materially weaker"" standard.  Alos, I'm wondering how credit monitors 
mergers in general.

2.  additional termination events - when does credit consider additional 
events like change of control, MAC, chnages to partnership agreement or 
structure etc.

3.  minimum transfer amount - how it works and how it is different from the 
threshold

4.  threshold amount - what triggers makes it reduce to zero

5.  enforcement of collateral remedies - going over the timetable for 
enforcing our remedies when a counterparty fails to post and the different 
cure periods.

6.  letter of credit bank qualifications - confirming with credit that these 
are still current

7.  cash collateral in Canada

Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with

the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you

termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?

Bill,

Yesterday, we decided to look at two options for Pueblo; a 60 MW case and a 
140 MW case.  In order to match these outputs as closely as possible with 
available equipment, I made the following selections:

Case 1
Equipment     3 X GE LM 2500 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 22 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   67 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  73.4 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  8170 Btu/kWh (HHV)

  
Case 2
Equipment     3 X GE LM 6000 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 44 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   130 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  143.7 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  7900 Btu/kWh (HHV)

There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized 
the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F 
for estimating power sales.  I have attached files that show the build-up of 
the estimated EPC price for the plants. 

The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file 
attached.  The projections are based on:

70% debt financing at 10% rate.
10-year project and debt life.
8500 hours per year at average output (97% capacity factor).
Gas at $4.40/MMBtu.

The results turn out pretty much as anticipated.  Even with the larger plant, 
we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.

"Thanks.  I'll call Tino back and tell him not to fret about what he heard 
from Maddox --I know Tino and Dennis knew about the Cobisa project and I 
think he believed Maddox was working on yet another project.  I can get Tino 
comfortable without breaching our confid. agreement with Maddox by just 
telling Tino that we understand there is just one project down South of our 
target location, not two.  Also, I'll let Tino know that early April looks 
like the best time to get together to talk numbers and we'll call to set it 
up when we are ready.  DF    




Lorraine Lindberg

Drew - Good timing.  Here's what I know:

1) Jack Maddox and I have spoken sporadically in the past about very nebulous 
projects in areas near TW.  (We even have a signed Confidentiality Agreement 
with him!)  After I read your memo, I called him to see what's going on.  

He is working on a 220 MW gas-fired plant near Belen, NM.  Houston-based 
Cobisa Corp. will ask the city of Belen to issue industrial revenue bonds to 
help it build this plant.  Power generated by the plant will be sold to 
customers through service agreements with electricity moving along existing 
PNM lines.  Plans call for construction to begin by Spring 2001 with 
operations to begin by 2003.  Kevin and I have a meeting scheduled with him 
next Friday, March 31 in Albuquereque.  We'll keep you posted.

2)  I received the economic analysis today which factors in some of Dennis 
Langley's wish list.  The ""as good as it gets"" rate, assuming the project is 
sized at 150,000 MMBtu and fully subscribed over the project life of 10 
years, is $.1631.  This does not include a) any ROW cost, b) a 50/50 split of 
any incremental revenue TW receives on its existing line as a result of 
additional capacity sold to serve new markets, or c) 25% of ownership in the 
assets and 25% of the cash flow stream after payout.  

 I need to continue working the economics with James Centilli.  In the 
meantime, our consultant, Mark Baldwin will hopefully provide us with 
critical market information near the end of March. This is also around the 
time when Tino should have his report on detailed the cost estimate of 
construction and environmental issues.  Maybe we should rally first part of 
April to see where we are.

Lorraine



   
	
	
	

Here's the latest Tino-gram:
1.  Tino's environ. consultants have not discovered any stop signs.  

2.  The Isleta is interested in granting Dennis ROW/lease for the power plant 
as well as the pipeline.  The power plant could be located on Isleta land 
adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation.  Thus, the power 
plant could be connected to DOE's existing powerline infrastructure without 
ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land.  PNM would not be necessary to move 
power to DOE.  Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant 
optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power.  (maybe  this 
could be done through DOE to an interconnect with PNM on the Scandia 
reservation?)

3.  Dennis is using Jim Slattery, an ex law partner of mine in DC (and ex 
Dem. U.S. Congressman from Kansas), as his primary contact with  Bill 
Richardson at DOE.  My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship 
with Richardson, so this seems very likely to be effective.  Tino reports 
that ""DOE is OK with the deal"" and the next step is negotiating the power 
contract itself.  Tino said that DOE is aware that the capital for the 
project will not come from the tribe so the tribe's interest will be fairly 
thin.   It is unclear exactly how much indian ownership Dennis and Slattery 
promised DOE.

4.  Tino has run into a power plant consultant named Jack Maddox who says 
he's working on a 230MW plant to be located west of Belen.  Tino thinks he's 
working for the Laguna tribe, but wanted us to find out who is planning a big 
power plant out there.  Is this ours?  PNM's?  El Paso?  

Finally, the next key step is obviously the economics.  Based on what Tino 
told me, I'm convinced that Dennis and Tino don't have a real good sense of 
how much $$$ might be in this deal.  They are groping a bit and our initial 
analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight.  How are those 
efforts coming?  

Thanks.  DF

When they were in Ponca City, Michael Keenan of EconOne (our damages
experts) advised Jeff and Caren that they need the following info.: 1)
monthly figures for system-wide firm entitlement (what our customers were
purchasing from 1988 until we stopped selling). If different from these
figures, then we also need monthly figures for total system-wide purchases;
and 2) monthly figures for deliveries of gas to the Mertzon plant. Please
let us know who we should contact to pull this together. Also, did we ever
get any word back on the question of what % of the total gas Northern was
purchasing the gas behind the Mertzon plant represented?

Hey Drew,
 
Sorry that we did not get to meet last week when you were in town.  I have 
pulled up some information on the project performance and wanted to share 
with the group.  I was very concerned by the comment that the project was on 
a rate to cost TW an additional $1.0 million for the year because the demand 
avoidance program was not in place.  I do want to confirm that Arnold 
Eisenstein at ET&S working on the development of the programming to support 
TW's efforts to minimize demand expenses.  It was my understanding during the 
development of this project, that TW was targeting a 75% avoidance for an 
annual basis.   I offer the following details regarding the actual operation 
of the station in 2000. 

Peak load for 12,000 hp = 9,621 kw x 3 = 28,864.0 kw per Quarter

Actual Utilization
   3rd Quarter 2000      % of Max  4th Quarter 2000  % of Max
 kw - generation   22,684.8      78.6   17,779       61.6
 kw - transmission 25,421.0      88.1   22,992       79.6
 
 Target $'s @ 75% 99,142      75.0            73,480      75.0
 Net Actual Rebate  $'s 75,935        78.6                105,181        61.59
  difference            ($23,206)                  $31,702   

Overall net for 2000 under Rate 21 appears to reflect that TW has saved 
$8,496 above their target rebate of $170,622 (75% avoidance) for the 3rd and 
4th quarters.  In addition, ECS has made payment to TW under Rate 19 that 
resulted in an additional $118,441 paid to TW.   Note that ECS has proposed 
to included the transmission demand in the Rebate process which is not 
specifically addressed the Compression Service Agreement.  


Currently TW has access to the web site that graphically displays the current 
Tri-State generation load as well as several years of month by month 
history.  This access was conveyed to TW as soon as the confidentiality 
agreement between TW, ECS and Tri-State was executed and delivered to ECS.  
At this point, EE&CC (now under ET&S) was notified that the system access was 
available to package the load monitoring programming.  As I mentioned above, 
that effort is underway.  

I will be glad to meet and/or discuss these issues when you are available.  I 
will be travelling most of the next (2) weeks but you can reach me via email 
or my
cell phone (713) 851-7703.   Based on the information that I was able to pull 
together, I just don't see the magnitude of dollars that seems to have TW 
concerned.
I would like to discuss at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,
mk

1. MOPS.  Suggested that the MOPS rehearing be brought to Madden's 
attention.  As a result we are looking at filing a motion to expedite.  Spent 
much of the week reviewing the MOPS proceeding up to date, reading pleadings 
and cases. Drafted a motion to expedite which has been circulated for 
comment.  While it is not very compelling for expedition, it is a way to get 
the proceeding brought to FERC's attention.  Apparently, there is a push to 
clean up old dockets.  Also it brought to my attention that Northern, in this 
proceeding, proposed to sell to Enron Gulf Coast Gathering, which I had 
forgotten.  so that if we find another purchaser, the filing will have to be 
amended. Also the Enron affiliate made the filing for the declaratory order.  
Kim Wilkie and  were talking about MOPS and what needs to be done while she 
is out on maternity leave.  We were talking about the waiver and ROFR 
agreements which John Goodpasture is getting executed.  We need to review 
whatever was done, if anything, at the time of the original filing to sell to 
the affiliate. Also take a look at the current ones to see if they would be 
broad enough to cover  not only Northern but a subsequent sale by Northern 
afilliate, if we should want to handle the sale of MOPS in that manner.
  2.  Attended the South End Task Force Meeting Tuesday morning.  It was a 
long meeting and quite productive. It was a brain dump by the south end 
commercial guys for Shelley and Mike and a man named Mike Gadd who called in 
from London who will work with Danny McCarty on asset deals.  It was decided 
to go ahead and start presenting potential deals to various Companies who we 
think would be interested in the various south end assets.  For exampleBob 
burleson is going to present a deal for some Permian assets to SPS.  SPS will 
have to divest certain power plants but still would like to maintain some 
control.   SPS may be interested in purchasing the pipelines form Northern 
and TW that currently serve the plants.  SPS would operate the line as an 
intrastate Hinshaw.  We think these asets are a good candidate to get Stans 
approval since they are not useful to get gas to California and the COS is 
$18 and incremental revenue is $2-3.  I will be involved in putting the 
proposal together starting with confidentiality agreements.  
Shelley believes that we should actively package and seek out potential 
interested buyers.  For example, approach Duke about the Hugoton area because 
Duke has a huge helium plant there. Also talk to El Paso because of its 
recent acqusition of CIG and ANR   and  interest in getting Rocky Moutain gas 
to Cailf.  Also seek out those interested in the Beaver assets and go make a 
pitch.
I am reading the existing contracts we have with Oneok as well as GPM/Duke to 
determine any adverse terms and conditions which could hinder a sale.
Another meeting is scheduled for the week of March 4 to go over the SPS deal 
with Stan.
 3 FERC Audit CWIP.  Continue working with Gary Zahn and Michelle Winckowski 
on a futher FERC inquiry on the Sublette work order.  Will prepare a response

happy to have you here!!

provides an example of the Hedge Documentation, (provided to us by the 
Corporate SFAS 133 team) that will be required to maintain hedge accounting. 


Drew, Tony, Lee, Bob and myself thank you for your input before the documents 
go for final approval.  If you feel a meeting is needed to discuss the 
content, it will be arraigned.

respective jurisdiction and expertise.  Apparently not.  Lets talk about the 
specifics of this incident when I get back to the office.  Actually, I'll see

Drew and Dot,
 It appears that one of our commercial/regulatory lawyers signed off on a 
right-of-way agreement that they simply should not have, and in my opinion is 
outside their area of expertise and practice.  I am going to follow up with 
the individual on this and it also appears that they were at least in part, a 
victim of a calculated ""snow-job"" by our brethern over at Enron Northern 
America as well as a misunderstanding of the marketing affilate rule.  Along 
these lines, I am concerned that some of our folks in an effort to be 
responsive to our clients may feel that they have to provide advice in areas 
where they should be seeking the advice of those who practice in that area on 
a routine basis.  I think it would be helpful for the three of us to 
establish guidelines for our folks on when we would expect them to seek 
guidance from others who practice in certain primary areas of 
responsibility.  For example, if an environmental question comes up, I would 
expect any lawyer in our group to talk to Mr. Reich or myself.  If an issue 
arose with respect to Northern's tariff, one would expect that the lawyer 
would speak to Maria, Drew or Dari.  

 Let me know what you think and we will go from there.

Lou

For those of you who didn't have the patience/patriotism to listen to your 
president for the whole hour and a half last night, let me share a 
highlight:  Clinton announced a new $1 billion program for economic 
development on the reservations.  Langley may be onto something.  If he/we 
can get the first deal done in New Mexico and assuming Gore wins, there may 
be opportunities to replicate the deal elsewhere.  I'm thinking of tribal 
lands in Minnesota, Wisconsin, S. Dakota, etc.  Perhaps Bill should call 
Chairman Ken and talk to him about changing sides.  Notice that I'm not 
volunteering to make that phone call. DF

"I agree with your concern but I've gotten comfortable that the pleading does 
a good job of finessing the issue.  Technically, you are right and PNM's 
service is neither ""firm"" or ""interruptible.""  It is my understanding that 
PNM  assigns priority based on a number of factors including whether the 
customer is a core customer or not, et cet.  I think that PNM is capable of 
determining on a contract by contract basis whether the capacity will be 
firm, even though the rate schedule may not say ""firm.""   Explaining all that 
complexity would make it unlikely that FERC would approve the rehearing.  
Nevertheless, I believe its accurate to say that we will only repackage as 
firm service the capacity that we buy from PNM and that they tell us is 
""firm.""  I think the draft does that, without going throught the unhelpful 
detail on how PNM handles its own priority system.  If I misunderstand the 
facts or if anyone disagrees with this approach, lets talk about it.  DF

I have a concern with this overall argument about firm and interrupitble as 
we stated we would only buy firm service from PNM, but moreso, when we looked 
at the detail of the PNM service when preparing for the technical conference, 
it is only best efforts-  does this argument fit?  and can we really buy firm 
service from them??  MK

Just wanted to communicate that I contacted Drew earlier today to suggest that
we check the pricing and execute the Conversion Agreement for Gallup.   As you
guys know, the recent price valuation for deliveries associated with Gallup 
have been 
well below the earlier market quotes.  

 Given the short term market reaction to the colder weather, we may be able 
establish
prices similar to the earlier market quote.   Based on the response from Dave 
and Drew
I have requested the pricing and hope to have that information by mid-day 
tomorrow.

01/12/2000 10:14 AM


As part of Enron's acquisition of the wholesale unit of Columbia Energy 
Services, Enron North America has a Precedent Agreement with the Millennium 
Pipeline project.  The Precedent Agreement contains termination clauses that 
are date certain for January 14, 2000.  These clauses have been extended 
numerous times in the past.  The PA also contains a clause that gives Enron 
the right to terminate the agreement if FERC's Order regarding Millennium's 
Certificate Application is not satisfactory and acceptable to Enron.  The 
FERC has not acted upon Millennium's Certificate Application.  The PA also 
includes an ""exclusivity"" clause (Section 3.4) that we would like clarified 
in conjunction with extending the dates in the agreement.  Millennium would 
like to clarify the ""exclusivity"" clause in an interpretive letter, rather 
than eliminate the language from the PA.  Millennium claims that if they 
eliminate the language for Enron, they would have to do the same for other 
shippers.  Therefore, we would like to remove the ambiguity of the 
""exclusivity"" clause and clarify Enron's rights through the interpretive 
letter.  If we cannot agree on the interpretive letter language, then we can 
still exercise the right to terminate the PA by deeming the FERC Order 
unacceptable.  The following is the language of the ""exclusivity"" clause, a 
rough cut that I have made for language in the interpretive letter and the 
clause pertaining to the FERC Order.  Could you please give me your thoughts 
on the interpretive letter.  We can then send the letter to the pipeline for 
signature by both Enron North America and Millennium.

Exclusivity Clause

Section 3.4  This Agreement shall constitute the exclusive agreement by which 
Shipper shall seek to obtain a firm natural gas transportation service with 
respect to Shipper's MDQ, except for agreements pursuant to which Shipper 
contracts for the transportation of its MDQ to and from the Millennium 
Project.

Interpretive Letter

Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3.4 of the Millennium Pipeline 
Project Precedent Agreement between the sponsors of the Millennium Pipeline 
Project and Enron North America (""Shipper""), as successor to Columbia Energy 
Services, Shipper is not precluded from obtaining firm or interruptible 
natural gas transportation services on any interstate pipeline offering 
services similar to the Millennium Pipeline.

FERC Order Clause

Section 5.1  If the FERC's order regarding Millennium's Certificate 
Application is not satisfactory and acceptable to Shipper in its sole 
discretion, then Shipper may terminate this Agreement by giving Millennium 
notice thereof within fifteen (15) days after the date of issuance of the 
FERC's order.  In the event that Millennium fails to receive approval of this 
Agreement from its Management Committee, to the extent required, Millennium 
may terminate this Agreement by giving Shipper fifteen (15) days prior notice.

Gerald --   To address your concerns raised in the proposed rider to 
Paragraph 11.2, we would suggest the following language be inserted as the 
last paragraph in Article XI:

11. __  Shipper retains its rights to raise objections of undue 
discrimination with regard to rates and/or terms and conditions applicable to 
Phase V service on grounds of undue discrimination; provided however, in the 
event Shipper has such objections, Shipper will provide Transporter with ten 
(10) days written notice prior to filing any such objections with FERC.

"Mark,  Attached is the latest version of the CMS Letter Agreement with Jerry 
Shrader's changes.  Please review.  I am OK with these.  Let me know and I 
can prepare the executables.
"
"Chris,  My comments are as follows:

 1.    The term (Article 4) was revised from the previous draft (month to 
month) to now being a definitive term with no evergreen provision.  Is this   
acceptable commerically?  Should we add an evergreen provision on to the end 
of the current definitive term?

 2.  Section  9.9 - Doesn't give a time frame for this approval process.  
Hattiesburg has no obligations under this agreement until this approval 
occurs.   What if it doesn't occur for 3 years?  Need either (i) ability to 
walk away from this agreement if not done by date certain, or (ii) assurances 
from   Hattiesburg that this is a short process or has already been 
accomplished.

 3.  Definition 1.2 in the GTC of ""day"".  Does this day match the gas day for 
the interstate pipelines?  If not will this cause problems in scheduling. 

 4.  General Comment:  Does this interruptible agreement provide the level of 
service that this power plant will commercially   require?  Hattiesburg can 
interrupt service at any time at  its discretion and furthermore, never 
provide service under this   agreement by indicating to Caledonia that its 
storage capacity is full with other storage committments.  Does this work?

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the

 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to ""game"" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  ""The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates.""
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (""FERC"") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at ""unjust and unreasonable"" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the ""power grid"", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.

 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the ""Class Period"").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were ""unjust and
unreasonable"" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
""gamed"" the market;

-whether defendants charged ""unjust and unreasonable"" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised ""market power"" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.

  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the""Utilities""), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an ""independent""
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  ""power grid"".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the ""Real Time Market"").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
""gaming"" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report (""the PX Compliance Report""):
/ / /
 ""During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state.""

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  ""Market power"" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council (""WSCC""), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
(""CPUC"") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

""Gaming"", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
""Gaming"" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
""Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

""At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

""The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

""The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

""Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

""Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

""However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

""Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants.""

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
""A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

""To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed ""mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices.""

 * * ** *

""Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production.""

""'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief.""

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee (""MSC"") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report (""the MSC Report""), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
""significant amount of  market power"" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, ""'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'""
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
""This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history"", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at ""unjust and
unreasonable"" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: ""Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation.""  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.""

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are ""persons"" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as ""any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice,"" and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any ""unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising"".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  ""unfair
competition"", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
""All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful.""

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;

interest;
(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable
relief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and
(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as
the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.

O'Melveny & Myers, in particular for California litigation,  but perhaps in 
other areas.  Over the past 2 years, we used O'Melveny in connection with the 
wind cos dispute with Florida Power & Light, and they did a great job.  
O'Melveny is one of the 2 or 3 largest firms in California and probably one 
of its oldest and finest.  One of their litigation partners (and good 
personal friend of mine) is named Brian Curry, and if you have any interest

We have seemed to hit a brick wall in finding out who has monitored the fax 
machine we have discussed on the 31st Floor.  Don Black's assistant, 
Claudette Harvey said no one really collects the faxes and it is used by two 
groups.  Kay Chapman another assistant on the floor said it used to be 
monitored by Hub Gavela (sp?) but he is no longer here.  We called the 
service number on the fax to see if we could get a ""poll"" report listing all 
the faxes that have come in and found out this particular machine only has 
memory for the last 10 faxes.  I have called Lucent (the telephone people) 
and with approval from my manager they can give me a phone report of all the 
incoming phone numbers to that machine since September 1st.  Please advise.

Thanks,

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
""Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability,"" said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
""We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company,"" Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
""By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us,"" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. ""It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position."" 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, ""When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community."" 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
""It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community,"" she said. ""We want it to be good for the whole, not the few."" 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
""I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs,"" Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 


	



TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

10/16/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
""A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,"" said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

Attached is a draft of a proposed agenda for your consideration.  It has more 
things in it than a simple agenda, but I thought it may make some sense to be 
a little more inclusive in the ""bullets"" to make sure we cover as much as 
possible, from the standpoint of understanding or at least being aware of all 
of the moving parts in CA (CPUC, FERC, court litigations, etc.), while we 
have everyone together at this kick off meeting.  I would view the primary 
purpose of the meeting to obtain as much factual information as possible and 
to provide everyone with a general sense of the types of the considerations 
that would be likely to come up in the bankruptcy context.

I am simultaneously sending this to our bankruptcy folks so I may have some 
additional comments or topics in the morning.  I also will send to you at 
that time a brief memo prepared by our bankruptcy lawyers that goes through 
some of the initial bankruptcy considerations, based upon our conversations 
on Friday.

Please call me when you wish to follow up.

John

California hits a new low.



Wednesday, April 11, 2001 12:15 PM

<!--TEXT-->

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a
reward of more than $50 million to anyone who has information that will help 
his
office prosecute power suppliers accused of gouging the wholesale electricity
market in the state.

Lockyer's Energy Emergency Task Force has been conducting an investigation for
several months into allegations that generators and natural gas marketers have
engaged in ""any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction in the
California (electricity) supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or
electricity.""

""My office is conducting an aggressive investigation into whether energy
providers have violated any laws,"" Lockyer said. ""It is possible that one or
more members of the public can help with information, and if so, the financial
reward to such a person or persons could be enormous.""

Gov. Gray Davis earmarked $4 million of state funds so Lockyer's office can
investigate claims of collusion, profiteering, price gouging and other
anticompetitive behavior on the part of generators.

Generators such as Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Duke Energy (DUK) have
vehemently denied the claims, saying their behavior in the wholesale 
electricity
market has already been investigated by federal regulators and various state
agencies, all of whom have concluded that the companies did not violate any
antitrust laws.

Recently, however, the California Independent System Operator, manager of the
state's electricity grid, concluded a study that found the same companies
overcharged California $6 billion for electricity during part of 2000 and 
early
2001.

Generators said the high prices are due to an imbalance in supply and demand 
in
the state and the high price of natural gas.

The ISO has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order generators
to refund the money to the state's utilities. FERC agreed, but gave generators
the benefit of the doubt and asked the companies to substantiate their
electricity prices or refund the money.

Lockyer, whose investigation has yet to uncover any wrongdoing, according to a
spokeswoman in his office, is now seeking a whistleblower.

""Anyone who provides information leading to the successful prosecution of a
false claim action may be entitled to percentage share in the award,"" Lockyer
said. ""Since billions of dollars may be recovered, the award to an informant
could potentially range from $50 million to the hundreds of millions of 
dollars.""

Davis has frequently referred to out-of-state generators as ""greedy 
profiteers""
and one Sacramento lawmaker has introduced legislation that would place a
windfall profits tax on sales of electricity generators earn in the state's
wholesale market.

Lockyer said the state should not be left holding the bag for ""greedy business
decisions of generators, marketers and utilities"" adding that he will seek
criminal and civil penalties if his investigation finds that generators gouged
the wholesale electricity market.

""Justice requires that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the
expense of California pay back what they owe.""

I went to the Courthouse today for the Vinmar hearing on the motion to compel 
and for sanctions related to the traders tapes.  Before the start of the 
hearing, we met outside the courtroom with Vinmar's lawyers.  They apparently 
finally came to the conclusion that the arbitration agreement covers this 
discovery dispute, and, after some discussion, they agreed to pass the 
hearing.  We will work with them to select a mutually agreeable arbitrator 
this week, if possible, and they can have this issue heard before the 
arbitrator.  This morning they mentioned three former judges as potential 
arbitrators: Ruby Sondock, Alvin Zimmerman, and Susan Soussan, although I 
think their preference out of those three would be Alvin Zimmerman.  He would 
also be my preference out of those choices.  They may send us other names 
that they would consider using as an arbitrator, but, in the meantime, let me 
know what you think about these three.  Thanks.

Christy, I am going to speak with Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal to obtain 
the most recent version of the Master between ENA and Transcanada Energy 
Marketing USA, Inc. and will forward it when I receive it.  I also will check 
into the status of that unexecuted Master as it may be that we can assist in 
getting both executed at the same time.  Thanks.

 
Energy Marketing USA, Inc.

James, thanks for the info.  Yes, I agree they should be the same.  Is there 
a chance I could get a copy of the one ENA sent out to them, not only would 
it show me how ENA worded certain things but would show me where ENA and EES 
agreements are different, so I can make sure we have same info.  If you could 
send me a copy of ENA's proposal to TransCanada that would be helpful.

Thanks. Christy

Energy Marketing USA, Inc.

Christy, attached please find the Master Purchase and Sale Information 
Worksheet for TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc.

Please note that Russell Diamond and Veronica Espinoza have been working on 
executing a Master Purchase and Sale Agreement with the same counterparty on 
behalf of ENA.  I have based the EES Master Worksheet off of the ENA Master 
Worksheet to remain consistent.  My understanding from talking with Veronica 
and Russell is that this Master is not yet executed.

In negotiating the ENA Master, a $60MM Enron Corp. guarantee has been issued 
benefiting TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.  In addition, TransCanada Pipelines 
Ltd. has issued Enron and any of its subsidiaries a $60MM guarantee on behalf 
of its sub, TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.  

Putting in place an executed Master is definitely the only way to go as it 
will allow us to net exposures between EES and the counterparty.  Please let 
me know how the status of the Master progresses or if you need my assistance 
to facilitate.  Thanks for your help.

Debra,

Attached below is a slightly revised Mac language for the Aquila Master.  
After speaking to Aquila today, we should execute both HPL and ENA Masters 
simultaneously (as both documents were sent over for their review at the same 
time--especially since we do so much business w/ENA & Aquila and the Master 
is so old).

Please confirm the above for me and let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks and I apologize for the delay in getting back to you,

Veronica

Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement



Debra,

I thought I would touch base with you on the status of the Material Adverse
Change language for the above agreement.  I did speak with Marie Heard
yesterday and she indicated she would contact you concerning this language.
Marie advised that even though this language was approved for the Bandwidth
agreement, it would not necessarily be approved for this gas agreement.

This particular language needed special approval from our CFO as it differs
from our ""approved"" language.  In light of that, I am sending you our
standard language in case the ""bandwidth"" version is not acceptable to
Enron's gas Credit people.

We are very anxious to finalize this agreement, so please let me know if
there is anything I can do from our side to expedite this.  I really
appreciate all of your assistance!

Please be advised that Ken Raisler from Sullivan and Cromwell will be 
conducting  Sales Practices/Anti-Manipulation Training sessions this week for 
the commercial staff.   The program covers  the legal implications of various 
activities of our commercial team -- particularly as they interact with 
customers in marketing.  The program also covers laws prohibiting market 
manipulation that might affect our trading and marketing activities.

The two hour training sessions will be  held at the Doubletree, in the 
Dezavala Room on the second floor at the listed times.   Please feel free to 
attend and observe (since legal staff are more likely to know the answers, 
you are asked not to participate in the break-out small group sessions).

  Session 1 Thursday, Sept. 14  2:00 p.m.
 Session 2 Thursday, Sept. 14  4:00 p.m.
 Session 3 Friday, Sept. 15  9:00 a.m.
 Session 4 Friday, Sept. 15  2:00 p.m.

Please feel free to contact me at X57373  or Mark Taylor at X37459 if you 
have any questions.

REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES


June 7, 2001
Notice No. 01-191

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS

FROM:
NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

RE:
EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION 
LIMIT RULES

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has 
approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current 
position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, 
heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the 
Friday, June 15, trading session.

For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of 
those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots.

The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the 
accountability levels. These are:

   Any one month         All months
Crude oil  10,000   20,000
Unleaded gasoline 5,000   7,000
Heating oil  5,000   7,000
Natural gas  7,000   12,000



Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted 
by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging 
requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to 
require that the position be reduced or capped.

There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can 
be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the 
market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, 
October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for 
December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 
contracts).

These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures 
contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a 
minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract.

These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the 
COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
prior to implementation.

Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & 
Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed 
transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as 
well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara

Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Martin

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

"From a financial trading perspective, the Credit Group is reviewing each 
potential counterparty and will not approve any counterparty that is not an 
""Eligible Swap Participant"" (as defined in federal regulations as over a 
certain size) from trading derivatives.  Generally speaking, they don't 
approve customers that are smaller than that for any trading from a credit 
perspective but that is up to them.

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  If 
you are currently on the new Outlook program, you may not be able to use the 
buttons below.  In that instance, please contact me at x39233 to volunteer.  

In addition, we have a need within one of Enron's business units for 
accounting majors.  We will be bringing several people in to interview with 
accounting backgrounds.  We will then make sure that the schedule will be set 
so you would interview these specific candidates.  We would greatly 
appreciate your assistance in this effort.  Thanks in advance for your 
cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

Kevin,

Doing some more month end clean up.  

I received an invoice from Peoples Gas to ENA for $5,000.  The description is:

For Summer-Winter Exchange Agreement between Peoples and ENA from June 1,2000 
through July 31,200 for 1Bcf.

1 Bcf Program Original Hedge:  1,000,000 MMBtu x .005 = $5,000

I cannot find a Sitara deal for this amount.  Will you please look into 
this?  They told me the deal maker is Richard Tomaski.

If you send me your fax number I'll send you a copy of the invoice.

Thanks,
Kevin

Just a quick request for you to go into all your books to make sure that 
there are no ECC deals booked there.  If there are any that are with 
counterparties other than RISKMANTRA, they need to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  Invoicing for November should 
start today, and both ECC and ENA are held back from invoicing until these 
deals are fixed, as the deals will be invoiced by the wrong Enron 
counterparty if they aren't.  If you could please let me know when the deals 
have been fixed, I can let the accounting department in Houston know when 
they can start invoicing as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this matter.

Thank you
Stacey

I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.  I 
propose the following:

1.   Retention Period  -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 
months

2.  Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only 
the deal terms at the end of a call

The first change could be made immediately and the second change would 
require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the 
traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal 
terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.

Dave, 

We will either: 

1. Find an acceptable structure for the LIPA PPA (unit contingent - no 
replacement energy risk) and complete the transaction.   LIPA is aware of our 
issues and is considering how they want to proceed.
2. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to LIPA - probably the 
best case scenario.
3. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to ConEd, Morgan 
Stanley, AES or NRG (we are now in the process of agreeing CAs with these 
parties with respect to an infor memo on the barges/deal), or
4. Let BargeCo keep the barges (technically they still own them now).

The time frame for resolving this is Q4.

stop whatever I'm doing if necessary.  I think on this particular turbine 
purchase...... there is great interest from ENA, Calme, and EECC third pty.  
I agree that in general - we can't take our eye off the ball with respect to 
the long turbines.  F.Kelly

Dave,

I would like to have a mid-year offsite with my group in late July.  I would 
like to include the associates and west CTG folks since they are a 
significant part of our team and we have a tremendous amount of work to do 
for the balance of the year.  We will keep costs reasonable by going to a 
resort that is driving distance from Portland.  Total cost is estimated at 
$23M.  We will have 1.5 days in conference and .5 days of activity (golf, 
etc.).  My assistant will send details to Kay.  Are you OK with this?

Regards,

Chris

Dave,

Here is PGE's response to the question you raised about how its plans to 
cover its short position in '02 and beyond.  Part of Pamela's response does 
not make sense to me and I will follow up with her for additional details.

Let me know if you have additional questions.

Hi, Mitch!  As of today, Oregon is sill moving forward with our version of
open access.  As you may recall, this is a fairly consevative approach.  Only
non-residential customers are eligible for direct access.  Utilities need not
sell any generating resources.  We will use a technique called ""ongoing
valuation"" to allow non-residentials to elect other suppliers while still
receiving the benefits/paying the costs of our current supplies.  We are
planning to be in balance (or long) for 2002 on a full load basis.  Thus,
while non-residential customers may elect new suppliers, they are essentially
fully hedged with our portfolio of long- and short-term supplies.  We have
also begun to raise the question for discussion whether we should fill a full
load position for years beyond 2002.  Those discussions will probably continue
the next couple of months.  One possible outcome is that we would fill all of
our load except perhaps customers over 1-5 MWs.  They would have the right to
""opt-out"" by giving us notice 1/1/02 not to plan for them beginning 1/1/03. 
Then, the Commission might phase in this option for consecutively smaller load
customers on a set schedule.  This would allow us some certainty and ability
to make longer-term commitments and also give the market some certainty about
what load might be available when.  Everyone is well-aware of our short
position and the implications of that.  We are seeking an amendment to
Oregon's restructuring law that would eliminate any date restriction on our
ability to treat resource commitments as eligible for transition treatment.  I
think this is a critical piece to ensuring that Oregon doesn't set up a cliff
like California did or Nevada appears to be doing.  All this being said,
whether Oregon's restructuring moves forward is ultimately an
emotional/political issue.  Bad news, even if unrelated to direct access,
could spook the Legislature enough to give momentum to the several bills
already introduced to delay/reverse it.  We will keep you informed. 
Meanwhile, our power supply folks are proceeding as if we will need to plan
for almost everyone indefinitely.

>>> Jim Piro 01/26/01 02:26PM >>>
I think based upon your discussions with staff and the commissioners you are
the best one to respond to this question.  Thanks

>>> <Mitchell.Taylor@enron.com> 1/26/01 8:49:09 AM >>> 
Jim, 

In the resource plan that you sent me earlier this week, you indicated that 
PGE was short anywhere from 400 to 700 MW, going out to 2006. What 
sentiment are you hearing in Oregon about open accesss? (In Nevada, where 
I have been focused of late, the drums are beating louder for longer 
delays). If open access (customer choice) is deferred beyond this year, 
how do you plan to cover this short position, especially in '02? Does the 
OPUC appreciate that you are short in anticipation of open access? 

Thanks, 

Mitch

I would like to put the wheels in motion to investigate the opportunity we 
discussed yesterday.  

Although my initial reaction is that I truely enjoy Portland and my current 
position (it's cold in Canada) and believe I can add real value here over the 
next year or two, the opportunitiy to build help build a business and broaden 
my experience with a move to Toronto is positive.  I need more information to 
feel comfortable making this decision.  So, please advise me as to when I can 
contact Paul DeVries and Rob Milnthorp (and who else I should contact) to get 
into the details..

Dave,

CSFB spoke with DPL today.  Pete Forster (chairman) said he wants to meet 
with you to discuss peakers and other opportunities on the trading and 
marketing side.  Besides 3200 MWs of Ohio regulated assets, DPL has a peaking 
strategy in ECAR and today has 400-500 MWs in development (interesting to 
have peaking strategy with no T&M).  They would like to look at our peakers 
to supplement strategy.  Forster didn't flinch when they said $400 kW is the 
ballpark number.  More interestingly, Forster went into his desire to talk 
with you about other ideas relating to T&M.  

Forster suggested 27th or 28th of July for the meeting.  You are more open on 
the 28th.  It appears Forster may be open to coming down here.  He wants CSFB 
and us to co-ordinate meeting schedule.  CSFB is DPL's main advisor, and the 
guys that negotiated the KKR deal a while back.

Apparently we are talking with these guys on the gas side.

This NY cap proposal must be prevented.   The proposal is essentially 
cost-based regulation.   Obviously, if the proposal below was adopted by NY, 
Enron's ability to make money is greatly diminished.   In addition, it has 
significant effects on the rest of the market in terms of regulatory 
uncertainty in the forward markets.

In the past, FERC has ruled to make caps consistent in all 3 NE regions (NY, 
NE, and PJM), which leads to quasi caps in the rest of the Eastern 
Interconnect.

Jim,
We need an action plan ASAP.   Please coordinate with Dana, Tom May, and 
myself.

Tom May@ENRON
12/14/2000 06:13 PM


FYI.  In the interest of all the developing markets, I think that we need to 
make a full court press to ensure that this does not get enough support to 
pass at the committee level in New York.  I will arrange a meeting with 
regulatory to plan our response.

Tom.




Earlier today, the New York Public Service Commission released a 122 page 
draft report prepared by its staff evaluating the NYISO. The report concludes 
that the ISO must pursue a wide range of operational reforms and other 
consumer safeguards to ""ensure a more efficient and stable electric market 
that will better protect consumers from dramatic price increases."" The report 
culminates a months-long investigation begun by the PSC last summer in 
response to problems and price run-ups in the wholesale market.

The major recommendations in the Report, some of which have already surfaced 
in recent ISO Committee meetings, would be devastating to a competitive 
wholesale market and would largely reregulate prices in New York. They 
include the following (taken directly from the PSC's Press Release):

Reforming rules and procedures to improve the efficiency of the market and 
minimize opportunities for market manipulation, or ""gaming,"" by owners of 
electricity generating facilities;
Initiating a $150 per megawatt hour price cap on generators to maintain 
reasonable market clearing prices;
Creating a ""circuit-breaker"" mechanism that will prevent market power abuses 
at levels below $150/MWH;
Lowering price thresholds significantly to allow the NYISO to step in more 
quickly to investigate and mitigate price spikes;
Granting the NYISO retroactive refund authority to return to consumers gains 
that generators improperly derive from market power abuse; and,
Creating a strong deterrent against price abuses by penalizing generators who 
repeatedly use improper tactics to raise prices above competitive levels.

The NYPSC, of course, has no legal authority to impose any of these 
recommendations. However, they are likely to muster support from the 
Transmission Owners, governmental entities and loads, that usually control 
enough votes to just  pass a motion at an ISO Committee. This will set up a 
confrontation with the ISO Board, which is walking a delicate tightrope 
between maintaining its independence and supporting a competitive wholesale 
market on the one hand, and dealing with the politics of a hostile 
Administration in New York. Last summer, as you may recall, the Board 
rejected the $1000 bid cap pushed through by the PSC, voting instead for a 
$1300 cap. That action was set aside by FERC, which reimposed the $1,000 
level and then made it applicable in New England as well so that there would 
be consistency among the three Northeast ISOs (PJM already had the $1,000 
cap.) 

Thus, whether NY follows the lead of California is likely to be determined by 
FERC, and it will have to carefully consider the consistency concerns it 
raised last summer in ultimately deciding whether it's OK for New York to set 
price caps below its neighboring ISOs.

Attached is a copy of the PSC's Press Release and Report.

All:

As some of you may be aware, we are in the process of negotiating with 
Central Maine Power Company regarding the assumption of a portion of their 
wholesale obligations associated with their Standard Offer Service load in 
the State of Maine, covering at least March 1, 2001 - Feb 28, 2002.   We are 
currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.  
They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point, 
there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items 
and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the 
negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an 
example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine 
PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract 
within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm 
pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for 
about 2-3 hours).

Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:

Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood
Legal:  Janice Moore
Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti
Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson
Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo

Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items 
subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is 
prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a 
chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 
28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you 
all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move 
quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with 
CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on 
outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.  Please feel free to 
call me at 978-449-9936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-3223, 
3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to

=DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options

  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to
build
as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and
give
new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in
the
future.
  While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -
above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be
sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable
future.
  The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased
demand
to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of
available
gas reserves in storage.
  Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric
generation:
from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving
economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.

  Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts
from
the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA
projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to
$2.81/MMBtu by
2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts
coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.
  Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle
gas
plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. ""It's awfully
hard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can do
it
at these prices.""
  However, a recent report from Raymond James and Associates Inc., concluded
that gas-fired generation will still be economical this summer even if gas
prices climb above $7.00/MMBtu because of high power prices in most regional
US
wholesale markets.

  Future Gas Supply Questioned; Coal Won't 'Go Away'

  ""The gas turbine generation trend is not over, not by a long shot,"" said
the
Raymond James report. ""Gas turbines use gas more efficiently than the
nation's
fleet of older, conventional boiler-driven generators that are fired by gas.
The
efficiency gains enabled by gas turbine generation will be more valuable as
gas
prices rise.""
  While gas-fired plants are much cheaper and quicker to build than
traditional
coal-fired plants, many industry observers doubt that U.S. gas supply can
grow
to meet future demand, expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet or more per
year
by 2020.
  ""Coal will not go away,"" said Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.
(DYN).
""The coal industry will figure it out. There are too many jobs involved and
it's
too cheap.""
  Bergstrom expects the rapidly expanding appetite for electricity across
the
U.S., which is growing 3% per year, will require additional generation from
many
fuel sources.
  ""You'll see gas will be used in most of the additional generation for the
next
four to five years,"" he predicted. ""In the latter half of the decade, you'll
see
other alternatives, like coal, come into play. Technology will create
changes.""
  Even some independent power producers who are rushing to build gas-fired
power
plants in the U.S. admit the recent price of gas, if prolonged, is a threat.

  Bob Kelly, Calpine Corp.'s (CPN) senior vice president, said his firm's
fleet
of 40,000 MW of highly efficient natural gas plants to be in place by 2004
will
be profitable even with gas at $4.00/MMBtu, but he expects owners of
coal-fired
plants to make additional capital investment to keep those plants running as
well.
  ""If gas stays $4.00 forever, you'll see more coal plants. It will make
sense
to put scrubbers on,"" said Kelly.

  Southern Co. Evaluating Coal-to-Gas Technology

  Gas has to compete on price with other available fuel, agreed Bob Carter,
chairman of Panda Energy International. Carter told Dow Jones Newswires late
last month that the idea of new coal-fired generation is ""very possible.""
  In fact, the jump in gas prices has given a boost to Southern Co.'s (SO)
effort to build a first-of-its-kind coal plant that seeks to be cost and
environmentally competitive with natural gas, said Charles H. Goodman,
Southern
Co.'s vice president for research and environmental affairs.
  Southern, with major DOE funding, recently announced a major advance in
its
effort to utilize coal in a more efficient and less polluting fashion to
generate electricity.
  The new process combines use of a ""transport reactor,"" a device based on
existing technology used to ""crack"" crude oil into lighter products, to turn
coal into a gas which is then burned in a combustion turbine much like
natural
gas.
  In its gaseous form, coal can be cleaned of many of its pollutant-forming
impurities such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,
Goodman said.
  The key to the technology is the ability to burn the coal gas in a highly
efficient gas turbine rather than burning it to make steam to turn a
turbine, he
added.
  The new technology can produce 100 megawatts of power with two-thirds less
coal than a traditional boiler-type coal generator, said Goodman.
  And higher natural gas prices could move this technology closer to a
reality.
  ""The urgency of getting on with this (coal technology) is the forecast for
gas
prices,"" said Goodman. ""At $2.50/MMBtu, it's a bigger stretch for this coal
plant (to compete with gas) than at $3.00 or $3.50/MMBtu.""

  New Coal Technology May Also Address Emissions

  Goodman said Southern hopes to make a decision in the second half of 2001
on
whether to build a commercial power plant with the coal gasification
technology
now being tested at Southern's Power Systems Development Facility in
Wilsonville, Ala.
  If gas prices stay high or remain volatile, Goodman said that will
influence
the timing, size and other variables associated with building the first
full-size plant to burn coal gas in this manner.
  ""The $64 question is the price of gas,"" said Goodman. If gas is cheap and
plentiful, utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology,
he
said.
  But because the U.S. has abundant coal resources, Goodman predicts the
coal-to-gas technology could eventually be used not only for new plants but
to
repower existing coal plants in a way that addresses air quality concern.
  Other partners in the Power Systems Development Facility include the
Electric
Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler Corp. (FWC), Halliburton's Kellogg
Brown & Root (HAL), Peabody Group, Combustion Power Corp. and
Siemens-Westinghouse Power.

Hi Daren,

Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters 
can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so 
that Anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me?

98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the deal 
is not effective until  February the 11th.
     No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the 
gathering (96026573) K which is the only
     K @ the meter.

98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is 
flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/2000 
production which is the only K @ the meter.

you please verify that you made this purchase from Swift?  If so, is there 
another deal to replace deal #114096 of should this deal be extended into

Stella:

The Swift deal is not pathed correctly in POPS.  I set up an accounting 
arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would 
you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID?  

The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement 
gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it 
either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the 
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up 
an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number 
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set 
up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you 
can put the contract at meter 9643.

Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.

Thanks,

Fred

"I have created a spreadsheet to assist in the tracking and booking of the gas 
supply related to Tenaska IV.  If you have suggestions or comments on the 
file, contact either me or Mark.

Megan - You can copy the Jan 01 Est tab and update the volumes with actuals.  
The file should calculate the resulting settlement with Tenaska.  I will then 
update the demand fee on the deal ticket to true-up the month.  Since we 
haven't gone through actuals in the spreadsheet, we may have to do some 
tweaking with the formulas.  Anyway, this should give us a good start and you 
will be able to see where we closed the month in Logisitics.

The file is located in O/Logistics/Cleburne Plant/2001FuelMgmt.xls.  If you 
don't have access, we can look into creating a new location on the O drive.  
The spreadsheet is attached for this month.  This is definitely a work in

FYI,  I was watching the position manager for ENA and noticed some business 
transactions on this pipeline.  This pipeline was bought by Duke Energy Field 
Services effective 8/1/99.  All HPLC transactions were moved to that pipe at 
that time.  The CES transactions that are current on this pipe should be 
moved to Duke Energy Field Services.  I believe the pipe was renamed when 
they bought it back in June or July.

If you have any questions, or want to verify this information, I would check

"Bob, 

I didn't check voice mail until this morning (I don't have a blinking light.  
The assistants pick up our lines and amtel us when voice mails have been 
left.)  Anyway, with the uncertainty of the future business under the Texas 
Desk, the following are my goals for the next six months:

1)  Ensure a smooth transition of HPL to AEP, with minimal upsets to Texas 
business.
2)  Develop operations processes and controls for the new Texas Desk.   
3)  Develop a replacement
 a.  Strong push to improve Liz (if she remains with Enron and )
 b.  Hire new person, internally or externally
4)  Assist in develop a strong logisitcs team.  With the new business, we 
will need strong performers who know and accept their responsibilites.

1 and 2 are open-ended.  How I accomplish these goals and what they entail 
will depend how the Texas Desk (if we have one) is set up and what type of 
activity the desk will be invovled in, which is unknown to me at this time.  
I'm sure as we get further into the finalization of the sale, additional and 
possibly more urgent goals will develop.  So, in short, who knows what I need 
to do.

A meeting was held on November 1, 2000 at 3 pm in EB3270 to resolve Exxon's 
residue volume issue at Teco's Indian Spring Plant.   Exxon's issue is that 
the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for 
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to 
PGE.   

Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved:

 1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line 
attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production.
 2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis 
elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects 
to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL.
 3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco 
can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes. 
 4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate 
the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue 
to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must 
pay to Teco an additional $500 per month.

Solution:
 1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884 
that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line.
 2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL 
Meter #986884. 
 3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset 
volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes.
 4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack 
Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d.

If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please 
let me know at X-36650.

Thanks, Clem

I agree with your assessment on keeping tabs on them but currently I don't 
see any real opportunity or decision to spend time or money with this 
effort.  I have received feedback from others in the group as well and they 
agree with our general thinking.  Have you talked with Louise lately?  We are 
announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in 
the US (therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets).  Maybe this 
will apply to these guys, someday.  Certainly it is not appropriate now and 
with your domination concerns it might scare them even more.

My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time.   
I'm out Wed - Sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that.  I 
really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal 
pending.  Is there someone else that is more appropriate, maybe someone can 
take them through EOL?  If you like that, please call Louise and co-ordinate.

and keep tabs on their development.

To me it looks more like a Streamline or Quick Trade product that is at the 
drawing board stage.  They are going to Oklahoma on Friday. William's may be 
the best group for them to ultimately hook up with. 

It is possible that the only thing we can offer this group latter on is a 
link to EOL if we so choose that to be advantageous. This market is too small 
and there is growing concern that EOL is a looming beast that will dominate 
market share. For now I need to continue to foster these projects until one 
is successful or EOL is no longer a political concern.

 Could you be available for a presentation Monday or Tuesday. I will 
participate via conference call. 

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Mike,
I just had my schedule changed dramatically for tomorrow and will not be able 
to talk.  How about Friday @ 10am?
Sorry, but we have a situation I must get involved with and change a 
direction.

I did review the email, and passed it on to others.  I do not see much from 
this site nor how it is actually going to develop real liquidity in the 
market.  If there are a couple of items that you want me to specifically be 
ready for , please send me a couple of comments via email or voicemail.

Thanks,
Mike

Our ability in crude is apparently very poor.  What can J Wilson do thru 
2010?  I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable 
volume.  

If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I 
strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru 
this structure.  Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain 
what the effort potentially create.

Thanks

 Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the 
Houston office, the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent 
on a 20 year deal is NOT a possibility.  If we had 1/3 of our GSA price 
linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels 
notional or about 14 million barrels PV.  At 5% our exposure would still be 5 
million notional or 2.3 million PV.  According to John, he would not be 
comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not 
consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 - 
2012.  Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically 
precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.  As far as the economics 
of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to 
figure out our economics.  I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see 
if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that 
the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for 
the time being.   Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue.

Thanks,

Eric

Eric, thanks for your comments. Please see below in blue our observations and 
answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions.

Saludos

Guido and Emilio 


Enron Offtake Agreement

Section 2
Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the 
EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to 
project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In 
addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.

 The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say. 
The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen 
(that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial  Close or NTP or Dec 31 
2004). We will add to this list ""the earlier of"" something like: ""the date on 
which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period 
of 10 consecutive days"". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to 
""commercial hand over"" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control 
and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement 
for 4 months  for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract 
while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.

With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project 
but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed 
with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or 
indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much 
the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or 
another EPC Contractor) already built in.  

Section 6
I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing 
formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this 
contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of 
Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 
18%.

 We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is 
something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they 
don't want us to sell down and then keep ""controlling"" new  LNG businesses in 
Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited 
exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that 
adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it 
very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance 
to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to 
use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes. 
Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial 
control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will 
clearly realize what our intent is.

Section 7
Where is the bonus calculation?  We did not include it now on purpose. We 
will include it when ever they ""remind"" us to do so. We want to have another 
fight about the bonus.
Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the  
terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one
I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are 
going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to 
put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely 
bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we 
want to make it zero  
Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No, 
we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and 
based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the 
mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are 
pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not 
convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included 
oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been 
bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will).  

Section 10
you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the 
Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?
 Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as 
off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if 
they do.

you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks 
accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.  See section 
18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.
 The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in 
Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that 
could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred 
to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that 
projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some 
examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs 
for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel 
safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there. 

Other
where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA 
default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA 
contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.
 In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that 
the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New 
York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity 
plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD 
clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it 
as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is 
sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the 
level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that 
PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project 
Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas 
supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out 
if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being 
relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum 
dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months 
- we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will 
be available). 

suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or 
tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under 
the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will 
we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for 
technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.
  Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it 
does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume 
that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks 
and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually 
guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top 
of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible 
(meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed 
production with ""Normal"" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we 
have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with 
expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG 
plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10% 
above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners 
making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the 
EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of 
production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders 
whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take 
contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However, 
as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by 
producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in 
the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will 
most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already 
did. 

What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is 
resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as 
well?
 The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to 
determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries 
should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom 
line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of 
defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by 
which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual 
quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur 
based on the ""reasonable constant deliveries"" provision, damages will be 
payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the 
extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.  Nevertheless, 
short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect 
the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.  It will have to be some 
prolonged period for Banks to be affected.   

Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will 
the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in 
your model?
 We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard 
(although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our 
model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be 
plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same 
or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather 
damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not 
permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed 
the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its 
obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments 
for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be 
willing to live with this?, probably not.

insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.
 It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended 
in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to 
PDVSA.

insert termination section
 In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an 
asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better 
protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law 
than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that 
90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They 
point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and 
prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law.
  
put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements 
for financing requirements?
 We will

I am enclosing a draft of the off-take termsheets to be included in the 
Participation Agreement between Enron and PDVSA Gas. These termsheets will 
rule the following transactions:

  a) Sale of LNG from the Project to an affiliate of  Enron for the plant's 
output minus PDVSA's off-take

  b) Sale of LNG from the project to and affiliate of PDVSA Gas for the share 
of volumes equivalent their equity participation in the Project Co

  c) Re-sale of LNG from the affiliate of PDVSA Gas to the Enron affiliate 
for the volumes purchased by PDVSA according to b) above

Please let Emilio and I know your comments about them at your earliest 
convenience. Please focus on issues with regard to our ability to MTM these 
contracts, such as the force majeure clause. If you have any comments or 
questions during the weekend you can reach me at 713 304-4264 or Emilio at 
011 5814 330-9016. Otherwise we would like to discuss this with you on Monday.

Thanks for your input and happy Thanks-giving

I received request for our goals on a voicemail while coming back from 
Venezuela.  I didn't know exactly what you  were looking for or the audience 
but i have listed a few initial goals and thoughts for each business unit.  
We are in the process of creating more specific goals for each group for 
2001.  Each already has their own but they are not in a final and consistent  
format.  We have an off-site meeting later this month in which we will 
address this as a group.  In addition, George and the coal group completed 
theirs late last week and Mark Tawney is returning tomorrow with re-defined 
goals as part of the process.

Also, I have attached some new global formats that I received as I was 
leaving the country on some specific items that we need to insure a 
successful year.  Most of this information has never been put together 
before.  I have projected out a 50% growth factor as a starting point and 
will break this down to specific groups and goals to insure that we will meet 
these goals.  As you know a lot of this was started when I put together the 
EGM presentation and gathered information for the analyst meeting.

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication

Mike Brown, David Terlip, Janice Moore and I met today.  Plan is for Mike to 
get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.  If Siemens 
amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's 
spec to us.  Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.   
If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.  
This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo 
""off spec"" demand separate test using ""ashing"" technique (more likely to 
pass) and if it passes using ""ashing"" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute 
over acceptance of ""ashing"" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected 
(either because First Gas refuses to accept ""ashing"" or because off spec even 
with ""ashing"") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative 
supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a 
possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.  
This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on 
spec.

Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a 
status report.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers.  And congratulations on the Sooners' win.

Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron

	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 

If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further

Mike/Jeff:  per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's 
plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could 
have on our LNG business.  The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up 
the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India 
from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions 
related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.  I don't know how much someone 
may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a 
relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling 
this terminal

We will discuss next week when we are in India.  Please advise if youhave any 
thoughts or suggestions

Rick, we can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week. Metgas 
is the only company that has any access to DPC's terminal. As you know, DPC 
is owned today by Enron (65), MSEB (15), GE (10) and Bechtel (10). At year 
end, Enron's 65 will be split to Enron (50) and new investor (15). Any 
changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC, which is 
heavily influenced, but not controlled, by Enron.

The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA, and Enron has this through 
Metgas. Under the TARA, Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that 
Metgas delivers to DPC. In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of 
terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real 
value here. Today, Metgas is 100% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has 
control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under 
current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity 
position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with 
someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable 
with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG 
role, we should discuss ASAP.

AG -- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with 
Rick and Clay.

Clay:  I suggest taht you meet with David Forbes asap.

Bill/Wade:  I would like to understand how DPC/Metgas selldown will impact 
Enron's ability to control acces to the DPC LNG terminal.  If an LNG 
competitor buys in (e.g., Total or British Gas or Shell) could they block our 
acces to the terminal?

Clay,

As you know, we are selling portions of both Dabhol and Metgas.  For fuel 
supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.  They will have 
BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of 
Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way 
the the various voting procedures are designed.  I am not as familiar with 
the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to 
negotiated something there since it is still in development.  Also, there 
should be attractive commercial returns with each project.

I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria.  
If they are interested, we need to get them up to speed quickly.

Call me or let me know how you want to proceed on this.


Bill

Bill, please get back with Clay on this and let him know if you think there 
is a fit. It sounds like DPC meets their requirements, but as Bill is leading 
our selldown efforts, I'll let him respond.

Based on the email below is IPIC worth pursuing??? Please advise.

David Forbes <forbesd@ipic.co.ae> on 09/28/2000 01:34:40 AM



Clay,
Thanks for the information on DPC. IPIC's current focus on India is to
identify investments with related crude, naphtha or gas supply needs which
could be filled by Adnoc or Adgas, with priority currently assigned to
Adnoc's naphtha. IPIC would also be looking for a commercial return, BOD
participation & strong minority shareholder protection. Does the DPC
opportunity fit this profile? If so IPIC could certainly look at it...

Best Regards

Dave Forbes

  Hi Robin,

  Congratulations on signing up for the best test prep course
  available! As part of your course, you get enhanced access to
  The Princeton Review's award-winning web site. Below is some
  important  information to help you use these services. Be sure
  to save this email for future reference.

  NEW TO THE WEB?
  
  If you are not too familiar with using the Web, you should
  check  out ""Web 101"" at the HotWired site. It's a great
  resource that'll answer just about every question you could
  have about the Web. You can find it at:

        http://www.hotwired.com/web101

  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  
  To use all of the features on the website, you'll need the
  following:

  SAT and GMAT students:

   Web Browser:
 
 PC Users will need Internet Explorer version 5.0 and above
 or Netscape Navigator 4.7 or above.
 MAC Users will need Netscape 4.7 or above.
 JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this.

 Finally, you=01,ll need a Flash and Acrobat enabled browser.  If
 you do not have these, you need not worry.  Simply click on the
 Requirements Check link after Logging In and clicking on the
 same link off of the Getting Started Page.  The Online check
 will allow you to download all necessary plug-ins.

 Modem:
 
 56 kbps or faster

  Students preparing for all other tests:

 Web Browser:
 
   Netscape Navigator 4.0 or higher or Internet Explorer 4.0 or
   higher. JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this. For best
   results, we recommend using Netscape. If you need to download
   a new web browser, you can do so at the following address:

         http://www.netscape.com/download/

   Modem:
 
   28.8 kbps or faster

  LOGGING IN
  
  Whenever you go to the Princeton Review website
  http://www.princetonreview.com, you should click on the ""Course
  Students Click Here"" button that appears at the top of each
  page. To enable your course services, simply enter your
  username and password in the appropriate fields on the page.
  For your records, here are the username and password you
  selected when you registered:

       USERNAME: robin.rodrigue@enron.com
       PASSWORD: 7@hzq*hq

  LOGGING OUT
  
  If you are using a public computer, like one in a library or
  dorm, it's a very good idea to log out when you finish your
  work on the website. All you have to do is click on the ""Log
  Out"" link that appears on every page after you log in.

  TAKING TESTS & DRILLS ONLINE
  
  Students taking GMAT, GRE, and USMLE courses will take all of
  their computerized diagnostic tests on the web. Offering
  tests online makes it possible to always ensure that you have
  the most  up-to-date questions available that reflect the
  current make up of the test. It also makes it possible to
  provide detailed analysis of your performance to your
  instructors.

  SAT students can find a plethora [if you don't know this word,
  look it up now!] of drills which target certain problem types.
  If you want to find an extra set of medium geometry questions
  or hard average problems, check out the online drills! You can
  also check out our multimedia versions of the same techniques
  you've been learning in class, to help you remember what you've
  learned.

  GRE and GMAT students, please hold off on taking any online tests
  or drills until your course starts.  Your Princeton Review
  instructor will assign each of the online tests and drills during
  specific points during the program.

  USMLE students, please take Test 1 online prior to attending your
  first class.  Your Princeton Review instructor will assign each of
  the remaining online tests and drills during specific points during
  the program.

  LSAT students, although you will be taking your course practice tests
  in a proctored environment (the LSAT is still a pencil-and-paper test,
  after all) the website does contain detailed explanations for every
""real""
  LSAT problem you will be doing in the course.  Further, if you
supplement
  your course materials with additional real LSATs, you will find online
  explanations for these questions as well.

  TECHNICAL SUPPORT
  
  Tech support is available at no charge to all Princeton Review
  course students Monday through Friday from 10am until 11pm
  Eastern and Saturday from 12pm to 6pm Eastern. You can reach
  tech support by either phone or email:

       Tech Support Email: websupport@review.com
       Tech Support Phone Number: 1-800-546-2102

  Once again, thanks for choosing The Princeton Review. You are
  well on the way to higher scores!

  Regards,
  The Folks at Princeton Review Online

Elisabeth:

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a

our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 

So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).

Liz-
We areleaving for Block Island on Monday and I wanted to get you some info.
for your trip.
I am forwarding by Fed Ex tonight keys for the apt. and for the house.

NYC Address: 156 First Avenue between 9th and 10th Street Buzzer # 21 Ground
floor apartment on right back ..
Good Breakfast place for Family is the KKK on first Avenue between 12th and
13th St... or is it 11th and 12th.. LOOK on right side as you go up the
avenue.. cheap and good with garden in the back......
Directions to house from NYC:

Take the West Side Highway in Manhattan to the G.W. bridge. Go to upper
level of bridge and stay in right side lane. ..take first right hand exit
after going over the bridge onto the Palisades ParkwayNorth. Stay on
Palisades until you see exit (9??)for Route 287 North to Albany (to New York
State Thruway) on right. Go North on thruway to Exit 19 Kingston. ( about an
hour ). Once through the toll, stay on the right and merge onto the traffic
circle taking first right exit to Route 28 Pine Hill. Take Route 28 all the
way to Fleischmanns Exit (about 50 minutes ....You'll go past Olive ,
Boiceville , Shandanken, Phoenicia, Pine Hill). Take exit and round bend
into town.
Look for first and only gas station on right and take right turn just before
it onto Lake Street. Look at odometer and 4 miles after you'll come to Elk
Creek Road. (You'll pass into a different county, see West Settlement on
Left.. , Grange Building on right with dairy barn and cows across the street
) Take soft turn onto Elk Creek and round bend over small bridge (vly
creek). we are the first house- second driveway - on the left.. White with
unstained picket fence. The key is for the side door at back. There are two
driveways .. use the second for easy unloading through back.

Our neighbors across the street are Barbara (blonde sister) and Pat
(brunette sister) Dury. (914)254 4360..
Eric Rosen (first driveway on left) 254 4643... ... Stan & Adele Seigel
driveway to right... feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the
need.. I'm sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford.. Karen and
Jim Rauter live on the high road.. (Lake Street extension) 254 4180.. they
have a little boy Julian about Sam's age.. Again please feel free to call
them.. She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit
environmental group..

Nearby Attractions : Eric Rosens pond...see his garden too.... Walk down his
driveway until you get to trailer .... garden on right... veer off left past
the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on
right.. Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond .. His new house..
(I helped design) is on top of the hill....Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.just
watch for fast traffic.. nice views.. walk through little abandoned cemetery
across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for
nice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to
Johnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through other
peoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon in
the yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's .. until we go off the road..We
also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it...

Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . .. Go back to Route 28 and
take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facility
with life guards and the  ""beach "" looks a little fakey from the road but
the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock.. There are some creek
swimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if  you see a bunch
of cars along the road chances are that's one....

In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public
swimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts.. another good
place to hang and play frisbee with the kids...
Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas.. or
hike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow that
road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on
right... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautiful
vista and a not too strenuous hike.. You can find these places on the maps
of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a
cabinet in the Living Room .. This is our too busy to put away depository..

For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on
the left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway.. it is the
cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on a
Sat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30
there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a
wonderful old round barn.. See attached maps....
Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping.... wine store..
cheese store and an A&P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place on
route 28 in Arkville.. He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster.....

Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good
browsing..
Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel with
restaurant and is very pretty.. also has good thrift shop..
Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by
relocated tasteful city folk.. good food!!!

Things about the house.... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our
pipes in the bathroom.. don't be alarmed.. just adjust the controls to help
get rid of it..... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking
or drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content-
We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the
basement.. The Spring is located on the ""high road"" going back towards
Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is.. go over little
bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 100 yards until you
see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the
left side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the road
across from the pine stand.... It is delicious water... The house water is
just fine for bathing and rinsing food...
Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as
the water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thing
if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it.. If it
gets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to the
public
showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could
borrow hers...  We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole
system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him
when we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville
where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in
the creek while you wait..P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is on
top of the Fridge....

Well I think that's the most of it.. I'll call you from Block Island with
our number there. In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or 911...our
fire number is posted on the mailbox... Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on Main
Street in Margaretville in the evenings... (there is a hospital emergency
room on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for some
reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician...
otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help .. she has an excellent
rep.


Have Fun and can't wait to see you !!"

Attached is a draft letter for your consideration.  Our outside counsel 
believes a letter like this would help us in our position that we do not have 
to continue buying energy when there is no transfer capability at the SDP 
because we know TVA will reject it.  Sending this letter is not critical to 
the sucess of our position but would bolster it somewhat.  Before deceiding 
to sent or not, I wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this 
information to TVA would impact us, particularly given TVA's actions today, 
re acces to transmission through third party transactions.  Lets discuss this 
afternoon.

""Lea Fastow"" <lfastow@pop.pdq.net> on 11/12/2000 02:32:32 PM



Mike,
As you know, I have arranged for a meeting on December 6th among the Art
Committee and Jeff Skilling.  I feel that you should run this meeting.  I
would like to accomplish the following:

1) Discuss our Vision for the collection
2) Introduce Ned and Barry
3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings
4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable
5) Discuss the process:  To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the
decision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Vision
and having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)  The
latter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but we
definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed.
Questions right now for you:
1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting?
2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so should
we postpone?  Barry is a ""maybe"".  Remember they are there to help us shape
a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any
purchasing ""mistakes"".
3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss it?
Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed list
of potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) so
that we have a Master from which to work.  I will run it by Bonnie McCloud
and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy.
Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we are
considering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to
discuss where his piece might fit in the new building.  I have also placed a
call  Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to
meet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would like
to propose a ""water piece"" for the circular drive.  You will recall that
Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there.  Eliasson is very
well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow ""up"" and
wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.  I've asked
his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in
Houston on their next trip.
Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hanging
in 50M.  Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Jeff,

To continue on an email I sent to you and Mark Tawney a couple of weeks ago.

As indicated then, over the past couple of months I have been building a 
relationship the Sr. VP /Head of Product Development of Wells Fargo Capital 
Markets Group in SF. His mandate is to broaden the bank's capital markets 
capabilities.

In the hopes of achieving this,  he has asked me to explore (with him) 
potential areas where Wells and Enron could benefit from some sort of 
strategic relationship with Enron i.e. bringing commodity, weather, credit, 
etc.  risk management capabilities to their broad corporate client base.

Mark has suggested to me that he would welcome the opportunity to join me 
(EnronCredit.com) in representing the weather desk to Wells Fargo and 
exploring any potential strategic relationship with them.

Do you have any interest in presenting Wells with Enron Global Market's full 
trading/risk management capabilities?
If you do not on any organised basis, would you just I speak to the desk 
heads on an individual basis to explore their interest?

Understanding you are incredibly busy, please let me know of your thoughts 
regarding your interest in this as soon as possible.

Thanks,
George Zivic

think I have to have a drink with a consultant coming into town, but I am not 
sure.  

Have a safe trip and I can't wait to hear all about it.  If you decide that 
Australia is to amazing to leave, I will completely understand and we can 
reschedule.  I wouldn't blame you a bit!  In fact, we could have drinks

Mike - 

Thanks for your voice mail of Friday regarding your trip to Tokyo.  As we 
have discussed we are in the process of identifying a strategy and forming a 
team to lead our Asian coal efforts.  

We view continental Europe and Japan / Asia as the next areas of growth for 
our group.  One of our greatest challenges has been identifying and 
attracting to our group the best ""Enron"" people, and strong industry 
players.  We have made some progress with the recent addition in Houston of 3 
- excellent mid-marketers with industry backgrounds.  However we are still in 
the process of building a strong European organization, and staffing Sydney 
with a core group of Enron traders and industry mid-marketers.  

Clearly Japan represents the single largest market for coal in Asia.  The 
other major markets are Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and to a degree India.  The 
largest coal exporters in the region are Australia, Indonesia, China and 
Russia.  Our staffing strategy for Asia is to initially build a core trading 
and marketing group centered around 2 - 3 experienced ""Enron"" guys in Sydney, 
add  mid-marketers with industry experience in Sydney and Tokyo, and hire  2 
- locals in China to look after our deliveries from PRC suppliers.  

Our experience to date has shown that industry guys orphaned in a regional 
office face certain failure. As a result we are trying to avoid the mistake 
we have made in the past of hiring local industry players, and then failing 
to provide them with proper direction and support. 

We are on target to relocate at least 2 - ""Enron"" guys to Sydney by Jan - 
Feb.  We will continue to search for strong industry guys in Sydney, and make 
any necessary changes to our existing structure there.  We have not yet 
started to identify qualified people with industry experience in Tokyo - but 
will obviously do so.  I will get with Stu and Joe to discuss using a local 
head-hunter, and advertising in trade journals etc.

We share your views on our potential for growth in Asia and Japan, and are 
working to put a team in place that will be focused on developing a strongly 
competitive, sustainable  business in the region.  Our initial goal is to 
develop Asia to the point where Sydney is running it's own books for both 
coal and freight, and we are a major supplier in the region.

Stu and I will be in Hong Kong and Beijing Oct.  7 - 11 to meet with the 
Chairman of Shenua Coal, and senior management of Shanxi Coal, China Light & 
Power, and Hong Kong Electric.  The primary purpose of the trip is to 
encourage Shenua to perform in accordance with their obligations under our 
supply agreement; introduce ourselves to Shanxi; assure CLP that we will 
perform under our term sales agreement; and start negotiations with HKE for a 
term sales contract.

I will coordinate my schedule with Joe, and will spend a few days in Tokyo 
(Oct. 12 - 13) at the end of the PRC trip.  We can coordinate our efforts, 
put a time line in place for staffing the Tokyo office with qualified coal 
guys, and discuss our overall strategy for entering the Japanese market.

I will be in the office Mon. - Weds., and am available to meet with you and 
Jeff to discuss the above at your convenience. 

 Thanks,

George

""Zerilli, Frank"" <fzerilli@POWERMERCHANTS.COM> on 08/08/2000 08:17:19 AM



By Fiona O'Brien
   LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The head of the largest yet Internet
exchange for energy products said it will combine traditional anonymity
with transparency to give traders a better overview of market activity.
   The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based venture
initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August
24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go
live soon afterwards.
   While market transparency will increase as dealers used to
over-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, users
of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, Jeffrey
Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.
   ""As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both
counterparties,"" he said. ""The real strength is that you (still) get the
ability to manage your own counterparties.
   ""You can list all of the people you want to do business with and put
in the credit terms under which you will do business.""
   This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a
""giant matrix"" within the system.
   ""(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't sure
they have ever seen the entire market,"" he said.
   ""(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals you
can't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market.""
   Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently
aware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market
transparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who
fall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.
   The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock
and will be accessible via the public internet or a private network
connection.
   Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco
<BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale
<SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>.
   Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operation
and Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominant
internationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.
   Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and power
companies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy
<UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy
<REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>.
   Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that
the founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will
face additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to
trade a minimum volume.

   TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING
   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believes
trading over the Internet could boost trading profits.
""The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a
paperless back office can really save a lot of money,"" he said.
   However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off given
that dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing
systems, as they do in current OTC systems.
   Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties will
receive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those
players' own risk management systems.
   But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own
clearing system.
  ""No one really knows how at the moment,"" Sprecher said. ""There might
be some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists
peer to peer.""
  In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurred
except those associated with trading. Membership is open to any
commercial market participant.
   Each product will have its own published commission schedule, which
Sprecher assessed at ""slightly below the best prices someone would pay
in the voice broker business"".  ((London newsroom +44 20 7542 7930)

John -

Yes, we received your check and forms.  The check has been deposited and the
forms have been processed.  The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions
will begin on April 24th.

As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to
you in February, but I don't believe we got it back.  Also, I'm concerned
about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds
available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.

I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review
concerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.  I'm thinking we could
knock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge
funds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESS
manager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PM
tonight or tomorrow night.  With regards to the marginable equity for naked
options question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?

Thanks,
Mike





mike:
just want to confirm you received my money and forms.
also, checking to see if i am set up to sell naked calls on ENE.  may be
looking to do something this week.  probably 100-200 contracts.

"i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  
still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than 
expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand 
curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get 
close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get 
us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : 
hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but 
it will be a tougher move from here.

"Hey,

It's 8:30 and I'm still at work.  Did I mention I really need this vacation?  
Anyway, I have a couple of questions for you.  Is there anything special 
you'd like me to bring over (that your Mom isn't getting for you).  I talked 
to your Mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for Turkey Jerky.  If you 
want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it.  Also, do you 
have any predictions for the weather.  I'm planning on bringing the following 
- jeans, sweatshirt, black pants & skirt, black cardigan, ""rain coat"" (I put 
it in quotes b/c I know mine won't be official), some ""go out"" close, running 
shoes, heels, and boots, 2 sweaters, varying tops, and a pair of shorts.  I 
always end up over-packing, but I'm really going to try to pare down.  I'm 
assuming you have a blow-dryer so I can leave mine at home. 

I talked to Darren today and he said Friday sounded good...and, I sent an 
email to Nick so hopefully it will work for him as well.  I also emailed 
Jessica's friend Ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get 
together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend. 

I've been checking out the Tube Maps on the Web and don't think I should have 
much of a problem getting to your place.  I assume I'm going to want to get 
off at the Holland Park tube stop.  Should be a piece of cake, right?

Any bright ideas of how to get your extra set of keys to me Friday morning?  
I guess there isn't really anywhere for you to hide them around your flat 
(i.e. under the doormat or over the door frame?).  

See you soon,
Susan

- I may have to pump Darren for a little bit of info Friday night (subtly of 
course)...Like did he know that I didn't know about Ted's ""past"" - maybe you 
can find out why the marriage ended."

I am taking every step to ensure that I leave this building at a reasonable

is definitely do-able.  However, I do reserve the right to alter my estimate 
when we get closer to 4:30 p.m. and I have a better idea where I stand.

We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.  I'm in 
need of a good chat.

Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about 
to pull your hair out.  Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and 
you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).  Please 
tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.

Lisa - Hey sweetie!  I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA, 
but Jen said it went really well.  We need to get together soon I've missed 
seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings 
ons in your life.  Tell Brad I say ""Hi"" and I'll be glued to the TV set just 
like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.

Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the 
""Fam"".  Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your 
Mom) is absolutely in love with him.  Keep me posted on your plans for the 
future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).  Also, I 
thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in 
your old hometown - Chicago.  Any thoughts?

Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at 
myself for letting that happen.  Please write back soon and let me know how 
school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely 
out of touch) are all doing.  My guess is you're going through exams as well 
right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success."

"Thanks.  As for getting talked into buying all the extras, I'm not as easily 
convinced of things as some people I know ( Cow fingers?).  Halloween at the 
Big E wasn't nearly as fun as I'd hoped...I mean, they keep the candy in 
machines and you have to actually pay for it...that just borders on cruel.

Rob has asked me to collect legal department views on the attached statement 
of principles regarding Security and Human Rights that Enron Corp is 
considering endorsing. These have been worked out over the past several 
months by a task force of the US and UK governments, along with 
representatives of industry (including Enron) and NGOs (including Amesty and 
Human Rights Watch) under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and 
Foreign Secretary Cook.  As a result, we really don't  have the ability to 
change the text, which is fixed. 

As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of 
their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines 
would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board 
adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I 
have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have 
the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these 
issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns 
from within EES and EECC.)

The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt 
of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and 
Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be 
implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express 
our view on are the following:

(a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not 
publicly express its ""endorsement"" of these polices?
(b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if 
any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in 
implementing the policy?
(c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might 
arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?

Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of 
your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel 
for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express 
any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so 
that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for 
Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been 
extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November 
15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get 
our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)

You cane-mail your comments or phone them to  me at 713-646-6309. If I get 
suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will 
set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US. 

Thanks, I appreciate your views and comments.

this.  Deborah, I need you to work  with  John S. to see how our 
international EES business (Europe, Mexico, etc.) might be   affected by this 
and whether we take this position.  I am sure Rob and JOhn will  have the 
history and expert opinion as to how this should be handled, and my guess is, 
this issue primarily affects EECC at this time.  Maybe one of the Apache 
lawyers can take the lead for the traditional EES business.   Rob will be in 
next week and then going out of town and I will pick up for him then.

Rob and Vicki:

Over the past few months we have participated in an initiative aimed at 
developing a voluntary set of guidelines governing human rights and security 
arrangements.   I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, review, and sign 
off on the guidelines.  

Should we agree to endorse the principles, we must send a letter to the U.S. 
State Department by November 8, 2000.     I have attached a fact sheet as 
well as the revised principles for your review.   

The principles and signatories will be announced by Madeline Albright and 
Secretary Robin Cook in November. 

Thank you for time and consideration on this.  Please do not hesitate to call 
with any questions.  I can be reached either by cell phone (917) 821-0724 or 
by  voicemail at 212-702-3916.

Best Regards,

"Peter:

I think your collective e-mails constitute the legal risk memo.  What do you 
think the legal risk rating ought to be?

Regards,

Mark



	Peter Keohane
	11/22/2000 10:28 AM
		 


Mark, thanks for the voice mail.  In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one 
should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as 
normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master 
Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following 
(together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the 
extent a risk memo is required.

In terms of unusual risks:

1.  We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master.  
However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially 
Government of Alberta credit risk.  Derek Davies is I believe dealing with 
Credit to resolve credit issues.  In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is 
taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which 
does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds.

2.  The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental 
guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for 
collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron 
Corp.'s creditworthiness.

3.  It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into 
back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are 
currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding 
and being successful in the auction.  Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the 
volume purchased is not properly hedged.

4.  As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk 
(as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired 
in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market 
rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.  In terms of the 
auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but 
our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post 
a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that 
the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete 
control of whether or not we can comply with the rules.

Peter.

(Milly, sorry for not copying you on my first memo - see below.)

AM 
   
	Enron Capital & Trade Resources 
	Canada Corp. 
	
	

Mark, as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is 
scheduled for Nov 29/00, under which Enron Canada can purchase for one-year 
terms, in each of three successive years, up to approximately 300MW/year #1;  
130MW/year #2; and 65MW/year #3, of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted 
back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last 
August.  The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US 
Thanksgiving is Thursday/Friday.  I wanted you to be aware of this, and 
determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained.

Firstly, Derek Davies/John Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent 
authorized by Lavo.

Secondly, bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction, the forms 
of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are 
successful, and requires a bid deposit (approximately C$6.5MM), but does not 
obligate us to bid and, provided we comply with the auction rules, the Bid 
Deposit will be returned after the auction.

Thirdly, unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms 
of volume and term.  In terms of documentation, if we are the successful 
bidder, we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical 
Master, which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which, 
although not entirely to our liking, is generally satisfactory.

Fourthly, the position will, I understand, be managed in the power trading 
book within approved position limits.  Note:  The nominal amounts owing (i.e. 
no up front payment is required) on an unhedged basis for the entire 300MWs 
in year #1 would be something like C$260MM, assuming a C$100/MW purchase 
price.  Year #2 would be C$114MM and year #3 would be C$57MM.

Given the nature of the transaction, the short time that we have with US 
Thanksgiving intervening, and numerous other demands, I do not believe that a 
DASH, Risk Memo and/or Board Approval is necessary, but please let me know.

I will leave you a brief voice mail to follow-up.

Peter.

Sharon - eight years ago before coming to work for Enron, I was a partner in 
a cogen development company which we sold in 1993.  It was through that 
company that I developed a relationship with Enron and subsequently came to 
work here in 1993.  

Since coming to Enron, I have maintained regular contact and networks with 
several of my former partners.  One of them, Barry Curtiss-Lusher, started up 
his own oil and gas exploration and production company, Nexus Resources, in 
Denver.  Barry has recently asked me to join his Board of Directors.  
Reviewing the Enron Code of Ethics (specifically, page 57, July 2000 edition) 
I wanted to provide the following information:

Nexus Resources, 650 S. Cherry St., Suite 420, Denver, CO  80246
Barry Curtiss-Lusher, President/CEO
privately owned
principle business is oil and gas exploration and production in various

Mountain states

My role as a Board member would be similar to any other Board role with 
regular meetings on a quarterly basis (teleconferencing is permitted under 
Nexus' bylaws) with all expenses, if any, paid by Nexus.  Currently, Nexus 
does not pay any cash stipend to its Directors.  It does, however, compensate 
Board members with Nexus stock.  Additionally, I would be making a minor 
personal investment in Nexus stock.

Pursuant to the Enron Code of Ethics, I would/will NOT be performing any 
managerial, professional or other duties which would interfere with my own 
specific job performance at Enron.  Nor is Nexus currently involved in any 
business which competes, directly or indirectly, with that of Enron Corp. or 
any of its subsidiaries.

Although I have been nominated and approved by the current Board of Directors 
of Nexus Resources, I have NOT yet accepted the position pending resolution 
and approval by Enron Management pursuant to the Code of Ethics.  Please let 
me know if you have any questions regarding the information above and/or what 
other steps need to be taken.

On Thursday afternoon, March 22, at 2:30PM in the Doubletree La Salle 
Ballroom, we will have an All Employee Meeting to discuss Enron Engineering 
and Operations Services (EEOS).  Mark Frevert and Dan Leff will join Brian 
Stanley, John Gillis, and the two of us for this discussion.  Led by Mark and 
Dan, we have been on a corporate journey to determine the best method to 
provide a resource base for the building , operating, and maintaining of our 
existing and planned major assets. The discussions evolved around two major 
issues. First,  most of the engineering and project management resources were 
concentrated in the former EE &CC, but operational resources were spread 
among several groups.  OEC provided operational support to some, but not all 
Enron assets.  Second, the clear need for both the engineering and 
operational resources was in Wholesale not Retail (EES).  There will be some 
need to help EES bridge into Industrial clients, but this need is minor 
compared to the requirements of Wholesale.  As a benefit of the time Mark and 
Dan plus other Executive Committee Members put into the decision  to form 
EEOS, we believe we are correctly positioned to effectively address Enron's 
major project needs.  Our Thursday meeting is an open forum to discuss these 
and other issues you might have with our new or perhaps more clearly defined 
position.  

We look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

"Spoke with Steve about the swap question.  He wants to talk with you about 
this before circling back to Knippa.  If you don't hear from him, and want to 
call him, his # is 281-350-8441.

Re. TW's exposure if we authorize ECS to lock in too early:

If TW defaults under the CSA, it must hold ECS harmless with regard to 
expenses incurred by ECS in the assignment of the electric supply agreement 
and pay ECS whatever is owed under the agreement.  No other specific damages 
are addressed, and the agreement specifically prohibits the recovery of 
consequential, incidental or indirect losses or damages.  (Section 9.2 
provides for reimbursement for ECS's reasonable costs in providing 
Compression Services, but only in the event TW uses its FERC out.)  The Gas 
Conversion Agreement provides for termination of the agreement in the event 
of default by TW under the CSA, and obligates TW to reimburse ECS for ECS's 
costs and expenses incurred in unwinding the forward sale of natural gas 
volumes to be delivered to ECS under the agreement.  

Other questions -- let  me know."
"Hey K!  Thanks for the note.  Everyone is asking how you're doing.  Sorry to 
hear about your back; I know what it is like.  As much as you are inclined to 
run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my 
back problem was just to recline as much as possible!  My house truly became 
a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.  

I really like your monosyllabic choices for names:  Kyle and Quinn.  For some 
reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.  Perhaps because 
it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.  I think you really 
have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.  Who knows, she might turn 
out to be more of a Gladys!  heh, heh!

The landscapers are almost finished with my yard.  It looks really good.  I 
even have a little palm tree -- required for the Heights.  The last thing is 
to finish the driveway -- right now there are 20 tons of black star gravel 
sitting in the back yard!

Time to work.
Try to take it easy!

Hey Susan! Sorry no e-mail lately. Things have been busy at work. I am also
tardy on my xmas thankyou notes so I'm hoping a computer one will suffice
for you! What would Miss Manners say? Needless to say we love all the stuff
you gave us. I am enjoying the knives - what a difference they make. No more
sawing!  Jim has worn his new shirt many times and loves the book. I too
thought it was a good Christmas, despite the pre-Christmas funk many of us
went through! It all turned out ok - even our time with Yvette wasn't so
bad!

Things are moving along in baby world. P-nut is moving downwards,
alleviating the pain in my ribs, but now causing sciatica (sp?)  in my right
hip and leg. I feel creaky and it hurts to walk. Not cool - I have too many
things left to do around the house to have to stay off my feet. Oh well. i
suppose it will all get done. We are still searching for the right name and
now need some input since we can't seem to make a decision between us. Here
are our latest choices in no particular order - Grayson, Kyle, Quinn,
Kendall, Lindsey, and Hayley (may be too popular). My favorite combination
is Grayson Scott Shelton. Jim likes Kyle Elizabeth Shelton or Kyle Alison.
Yes, we know Kyle is usually a boy's name, but we had a female intern at JRA
one summer named Kyle and I thought it was cool. One of my baby name books
has both Kyle and Quinn on the ""truly unisex names"" list. Any comments or
new suggestions are appreciated!

Must get going on work. Hope to hear from you soon.

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

I'm planning to be out August 28 - Sept 1.
"I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect 
agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
the following steps:

1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 
of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) 
provides that either party may terminate the OBA ""at the end of the primary 
term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice"" to 
Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
gone month-to-month.)

2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect 
agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 
Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement ""may 
be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
the event the OBA between the parties is terminated.""

As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme 
measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh 
our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions."
"First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem 
with Deron moving in.  However, in return I would ask for increased rent of 
$650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use 
and wear & tear.  After you read this let me know whether you think this is 
reasonable.

I'll try to answer all your questions:

Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to
make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse 
as
we would be removing light items for heavier items. 

A.  I really do not think it is a problem.  In addition to the oak floor, 
there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.  I'd draw the line at a 
waterbed, though!

Q.  The stove is a bit problematic... 

A.  No problem to look into this.  I'm sure it can be repaired.  I will give 
the appliance folks a call.  

Q.  Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed? 

A.  I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any 
internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.

Q.  Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for 
sure?

A.  I have a bad feeling about those connections!  I'll get them up and 
running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.

Q.  I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric? 

A.  I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more 
economical.  Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and 
towels dry than with electric!
If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.

Q.  At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as 
the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this?

A.  I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern 
would look really cute in there.  It's cheap to install and fairly easy 
except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old 
stuff is going to be a you-know-what.  I will call & ask my handyman, unless 
you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.

Q.  Do you know if any paint is leftover?

A.  The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be 
some left in the garage.  I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at 
the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.

The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and 
helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use 
that middle space.  I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to 
park on the street.  The other option is to get one of the back garage doors 
working so there is access to the garage from the alley.  If I did this do 
you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?

As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking 
the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get 
everything done then if that's okay with y'all.

Call if you have further questions!

 Transwestern estimates it will need less than 10 minutes for direct 
testimony.  Transwestern does not at this time intend to cross-examine any 
witnesses; however, it reserves the right to request a reasonable amount of

"I would expect that Sarah Tomalty will attend anyway to make sure we make

	From:  Glen Hass                           06/14/2000 08:25 AM
	



Assuming they are willing to withdraw their protest if we agree to this level 
of capacity, do they plan to attend the Tech. Conf.?


   
	
	
	

Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably 
(i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would 
amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can 
acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from 
becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never 
been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether 
this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same 
concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our 
proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.  




"
"Drew, here's an excerpt from a FERC letter order accepting for filing a 
nonconforming agreement filed 
by Dynegy Midstream...sounds a little bit like what the TW guys are trying to 
do, if I understand the 
concept of volumetric rates correctly.  Left a message for my friend at DMP 
but he (like everyone else)
is out 'til next year.  But since there were no subsequent orders issued in 
the docket I assume there were 
no problems with the filing.

I'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand/ $0.02 commodity + file 
as nego. rate approach.
If Steve Harris is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I 
will draft something and send it your way.

* * *
The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service 
under DMP's Rate Schedule
FTS. Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement 
specifies that KGS will pay
a volumetric rate. The volumetric rate will equal DMP's maximum interruptible 
transportation service rate as
set forth in DMP's tariff. . .The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as 
KGS' maximum daily reservation 
quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 9999999 and (c) 
identifies five primary delivery points for 
KGS. . . Upon filing Docket No. RP99-240-000, DMP stated that it agreed to 
the above negotiated rate so 
that KGS could serve small residential customers on DMP's system under a firm 
rate schedule."
"Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.

There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
""market-based.""  At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having 
to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack 
market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the 
legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in 
feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a 
separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the 
filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.

The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) 
is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every 
shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have 
to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other 
words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply 
execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two 
advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate 
theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.

I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to 
discuss the following topics:

1)  Your comments and questions on this draft,
2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract 
work from a logistical standpoint,
3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and
4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting 
time.
I will be out Mon. and Tues.

Thank you for all the comments.  Here is a last draft of our GPG rehearing 
comments.  Please forward any additional comments no later than noon, Friday 
March 10.

Significant changes from the last draft are as follows:
1.  We are asking the Commission to eliminate the peak/off-peak cost & 
revenue study, rather than clarify that the study applies only to excess 
revenues. (p.2)
2. References to the TW Global Settlement have been removed. The reference to 
existing settlements is more generic and included only to preserve our 
rights. (p.4)
3. A new argument on ROFR has been added.  We are asking the Commission to 
immediately apply the new policy that ROFR does not apply to discount rate 
agreements. (p.5-6)
4.Several reporting arguments have been deleted -- masking shipper names, 
clarifying that only senior employee names have to be posted and clarifying 
the Sept. 1 reporting date.  With respect to these last two arguments, we 
have decided that we can interpret it our way without further clarification.
5.New clarification concerning the date for which the lifting of the price 
caps on capacity release is to be implemented.

Attached below is Jeff Fawsett's  3/22/00 note to Calpine with TW's 3/20/00 
draft of the Operating Agreement .  What changes if any did Calpine require 
to this draft?  Please note that Section 5.4 of the attached 3/20/00 draft is 
substantively identical to my further-revised Section 5.4 (with subsections A 
and B) that I forwarded to you a few days after Jeff's note to Calpine.

 From our meeting this morning I understand that Jeff appears adverse to 
Transwestern's claiming zero financial responsibility for damages to 
Calpine's Measurement and Control Facilities that result from TW's O&M 
Services.  Consequently, I made some modifications to Articles 4 and 5 of the 
3/20/00 draft for TW management's consideration.  These changes are noted in 
the attached document marked ""CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00"".  
With my 10-18-00 revisions, TW places a limit on its liability to Calpine for 
loss or damage incurred by Calpine due to TW's Services, including loss or 
damage to the existing M&C Facilities,  if and to the extent damage is caused 
by TW's negligent acts or omissions.  To complete my modification to Section 
5.3, TW is to insert the maximum aggregate amount of financial liability it 
is willing to assume in any contract year.  This amount could be the amount 
of Calpine's deductible on its property insurance coverage or a lesser 
amount.  Whatever the amount chosen, please remember that TW is self-insured 
for the first $2M, each occurrence.  Therefore, what is the amount of risk 
that TW is willing to pay out of its earnings if Calpine claims damage to its 
existing Facility due to TW's negligent operations?  That is the amount to 
insert in the blank space in Section 5.3.  

FYI, the changes in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 (b) and (c), and the striking of 
Section 4.1 (d) do not create any substantive changes to the 3/20/00 draft.  
I  made the latter changes for stylistic reasons and to correct typos and 
redundancies.  Please call me if you have any questions and to let me know 
the status of this document.  I have lost track of my notes on the status of 
TW Operations' review and approval of the list of Services included in 
Exhibit B; this needs to be determined by Jeff (or his designee) before the 
final definitive agreement is prepared for signing.

Chad,
Sorry it took so long to get back with you, but we've had some folks out 
(including me) on Spring Break with their kids.  Attached is a draft of the 
Operating Agreement covering TW's operation of the metering station.  It's 
pretty much a standard form agreement for TW, with the possible exception of 
the exhibit defining the operating parameters of the South Point plant.  As I 
mentioned to you in our meeting in Pleasanton, the operating parameters 
exhibit is a useful tool for both companies to assist in identifing some of 
the operating conditions the plant might encounter and the ability of TW to 
load follow those conditions.  I made a number of assumptions regarding the 
burn rates for your facilities, especially the base rate and minimum rates.  
You'll likely have to fine tune those numbers.   Also, I've yet to ask our 
engineers to secure the documentation necessary to complete Exhibit ""A"" from 
your 3rd party engineers.  We'll include it in the final version.  Please 
give me a call after you and your team has had a chance to review.  Thanks.







"
"Jeff, here it is.  Take a look and if you have any questions, I'll be 
prepared to address them promptly so you can send this off.
"
"Brian:  because of the travel time involved, TW would prefer to reverse the 
schedule on May 24 (i.e., retail first, capacity second) -- if no one has any 
objections/conflicts.

I have scheduled two days of panel practice cross-examination for those 
testifying to the Comprehensive Settlement in the GIR/NGS proceeding.? The 
first, scheduled for May 24, will be held in the Sutter Room A&B of the 
Hilton Hotel (on O'Farrell) in SFO.? The session is scheduled to go from 
9:00AM to 5:00PM.? Lunch will be brought in.? On May 25, we will meet in the 
same room at the Hilton immediately following the PHC that is scheduled for 
10:00AM at the Commission's offices.? This practice cross session will start 
no later than 12Noon and go to 4:00PM.? Lunch will also be available.

I am soliciting feedback from you on how we utilize our time most 
efficiently.? As of today, we have 11 witnesses sponsoring testimony.? Given 
that the majority of testimony is related to capacity matters, I'd like to 
suggest we bifurcate the sessions, devoting May 24 from the hours of 
9:00AM-2:00PM to capacity issues and 2:00PM-5:00PM to the retail panel.? On 
the 25th, we would go from 12Noon-2:30PM on capacity and 2:30-4:00PM on 
retail matters. 

I would also like to suggest that parties work with their respective 
witnesses prior to the panel hearings.? We should concentrate on nailing down 
the substance of our arguments prior to the 24th and then work to reach 
alignment between the various witnesses over the two day practice sessions.? 
After reviewing the draft testimony's over the last few days, I think we are 
going to be in an excellent position to persuasively argue that the 
Comprehensive Settlement resolves all of the Commission's most promising 
options.

Chad,
Sorry it took so long to get back with you, but we've had some folks out 
(including me) on Spring Break with their kids.  Attached is a draft of the 
Operating Agreement covering TW's operation of the metering station.  It's 
pretty much a standard form agreement for TW, with the possible exception of 
the exhibit defining the operating parameters of the South Point plant.  As I 
mentioned to you in our meeting in Pleasanton, the operating parameters 
exhibit is a useful tool for both companies to assist in identifing some of 
the operating conditions the plant might encounter and the ability of TW to 
load follow those conditions.  I made a number of assumptions regarding the 
burn rates for your facilities, especially the base rate and minimum rates.  
You'll likely have to fine tune those numbers.   Also, I've yet to ask our 
engineers to secure the documentation necessary to complete Exhibit ""A"" from 
your 3rd party engineers.  We'll include it in the final version.  Please 
give me a call after you and your team has had a chance to review.  Thanks.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair

RE: Conference Call on FERC NOPR on Revised Public Utility 
      Filing Requirements
      ?Friday, September 7th at 2:30 p.m.

On July 26th, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing to replace its current filing requirements for short- and long-term service agreements with an electronically-filed Index of Customers, among other changes.  Comments are due to FERC on or before October 5th.  On August 8th, EPSA sent out a memo briefly summarizing the Order and identifying some possible issues of concern.  If you have any additional issues, please forward them to Jackie Gallagher at jgallagher@epsa.org.

We will hold a conference call on Friday, September 7th at 2:30 p.m. to discuss issues for possible comments on the NOPR.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please contact Jackie Gallagher at 202-628-8200.

I just wanted to second Sue's motion about the idea of a map to demonstrate the visual and substantive clarity of FERC's Super RTO model.  The map could be augmented with information on how those regions come closer to be aligned with actual power needs and flows.  I recall attending an EPSA conference for congressional staff soon after I arrived (June or so) which showed the crazy quilt-like map of the then-proposed RTOs that just looked unworkable.  The simplicity of the Super RTO model -- combined with some basic power idea -- will be a powerful lobbying tool.




Janel----as you know, most of the interaction on RTOs that I have had is with the Governors, and more specifically the western govs, so my comments are directed to them, but I think these suggestions could work for other influencers as well.
 
RTOs are not a readily understandable issue for a governor who has 50-100 issues every week to cover, nor is there a natural constituency that would politically support a governor getting involved, nor is it an issue that they care about---they just want the lights to go on and their voters to have moderate prices and reliability and for the energy crisis to go away if they perceive that it is affecting them.  Those that know a little bit about the RTOs are following their incumbent utility lead in opposing a west wide RTO, they are invoking the ""states rights"" mantra, and they don't want to be in the same  playground as California. 
 
I would suggest that we need materials/information (probably a power point of 5-8 pages)as follows:
 
    1  A description of the RTOs and generally what our position is, in plain english, in 3 sentences or less.
 
    2.  A minimum of 2 or 3 analogies to a well designed RTO.  The analogies need to be fleshed out...ie, cover all objections and questions.  The one that comes to mind is Eisenhower and the federal highway system--when/how it happened; who protested and why they were wrong; how great the highway system was for the economy and quality of life, etc.  Governors need something they can use as a sound bite and something they understand well to use as an analogy.  They do not want to look stupid, and most of them know little about energy, and so we need to give them something very simple to use as their underlying reasoning for supporting our position.
 
    3  Identify and describe only the the 2 or 3 most important, specific issues that we need to see addressed in the RTOs---native load exemption gone/congestion management solutions/timing or whatever Steffes and team identify.
 
    4. Specifically set out what the objections of other parties would be to the governor supporting our position on those 3 issues identified.  (this is key in making sure that they trust our information, and it also makes sure that they are prepared to answer the objections)  Specifically set out what the answer is to overcome those objections.
 
    5. Provide positive effects of a governor agreeing with the 2 or 3 issues--why he/she should  take our position ie better reliability, more transmission or generation will be built if system is truly open, keep them from getting screwed by California, etc.
 
    6.  somewhere in here we also need a very simple map so they can visualize what RTOs are.
 
 
 
 
    
 
    
 
    




Today I contacted our friends at Frontier Economics and at Tabors Caramanis about developing a set of talking points and leave-behinds for future RTO meetings (outside of the mediation process) with Governors, State Legislatures, Utility Commissioners and Members of Congress.  
 
In order to adequately provide us with the materials we need, both firms are interested in getting a better idea of the following:
 

who (which individuals) are raising concerns about the RTO Concept that FERC/Enron are advocating 
what specifically are the arguments these critics are making against the single, mandatory RTO concept? 
What are the priority issues that need addressing in your regions?  (We'll probably have to develop different documents depending on who we are talking with).

Each of you contacted me this week about wanting to meet with various policymakers in order to address their concerns and deliver our message.  Before you schedule your meetings, I think it's important to arm you with materials that can be left behind that summarize and/or outline your arguments for a single RTO.  Your feedback is important so PLEASE send me an email by Thursday outlining the feedback you've recently received and topics that you want Frontier Economics and TC to address.
 
Time is of the essence so please send me whatever thoughts you have so that I can forward to FE and TC.  
 
Thanks!  "

Importance:	High

Jim, please see me about this issue.  As you can see, Leslie and I have been working extensively with Stephanie Miller for the last few weeks as she is trying to find a way to get rid of our 200,000 MMBtu/day of Block 2 capacity on El Paso.  In fact, I provided Stephanie an analysis of the regulatory history as far back as last March, even before we signed up for the capacity.  You will probably be getting some questions about it from Barry or maybe even Lavarato before too long since getting rid of this asset is very high on their priority list.  I wanted you to be up to speed on our input so far.

 

The CPUC was heavily involved in the settlement and their interest is making sure that northern CA has access to the SJ supplies.  Their concern is not the same as PG&E's.  And to the extent anything is agreed to, reopening the settlement is an enormous can of worms, and I don't think we want to go there.  We would have to be able to structure a side deal to where PG&E and SoCal are in agreement that the recall rights they got in the settlement can be waived.

 

Steph - Leslie and I were just talking about this, and one thing we need to keep in mind is that any attempt to modify the PG&E recall rights would almost certainly be opposed by the CPUC, especially if it was to benefit Enron.  

 

I thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Paso's interpretation of the 24 hours recall rights.  Regulatory treatment of the 58 million by PG&E is a CPUC issue.  I just talked to Becky and I don't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights, but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more.

 

As to the 24-hour recall, I can only tell you what the FERC order says, I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the 24 recall to work.  The order is fairly terse, and just says ""and if it so recalled (by PG&E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&E  service territory upon 24 hours notice.""  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.

As to the ""traditional rate making"" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out. 



 

When is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?

How would you value what's left of the $58 million that PG&E paid based upon traditional rate making policies? I believe there are at least 5 years left on the term of the settlement.

Please call if you have any questions,

Regards,

Stephanie



 

Here is a short memo.  do you need more?
 << File: Stephaniememo.doc >> 

 

We you able to pull together a clear, definitive conclusion on how the RE-recall rights work?
I was not able to - hence my mission for greater clarification of specifics....


 


I looked over all the orders and the contracts and I agree with both of your interpretation of the recall rights of Block II.  PG&E did not make a very smart deal for $58 million.

The following energy bills will be heard today.

SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher), SCE MOU, will be heard by the Assembly Energy, Costs
and Availability Committee upon adjournment of the Assembly Transportation
Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly
Natural Resources Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 447.  This measure would
require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
energy.

"Looks good.  I need to find a different version of Code of Conduct that more closely mimics EPMI and PGE version.  The agreement in Appendix B right now may be too restrictive for our current dealings.  
 
Agree that we need to finish up details of (a) data transfer and (b) transistional services agreement.
 
In my discussions on Friday, the transitional services will be ""agent"" type activities.  Enron needs help in making sure that it can service its contracts.  No UBS Warburg Energy employee will make commercial decisions for Enron - simply perform directed activities.
 
The question of data transferred is still outstanding, but I will hopefully know more on Monday am.  I am checking on exactly how much Counterparty info will be held by UBS Warburg Energy.
 
I plan on being in your office first thing Tues am.
 
Thanks,

Here is what I had come up with. My thought is that the bold Roman

numeral headings would make up an agenda, which we should send to

Cindy Marlette on Monday, along with a list of those who will

attend for UBS.  The subheadings, which would not appear on the

what we send to FERC, would be the main items for discussion.

I don't think your approach and mine are very far apart.  I might

be somewhat less affirmative about raising the Section 203 issue.

It will surely come up as we describe what will or will not be

transferred.

I also think it would be very helpful to clear up the points about

the approach to existing Enron customers, and the transitional

arrangements before the meeting  I would like, in any event, to

put something into the MBR application on transition arrangements

that is more definitive--in the right way--than footnote 12 of the

draft I sent out yesterday.








Nick --

Here is a draft of some talking points on the FERC meeting.  May

need to shorten.  I am very concerned about the data UBS will

acquire and the access to contracts, and implications for 203.

Dear Steve, Rick, and Jim:

I thank you for the opportunity to work with you and your staff over the
past six months. I truly expanded my understanding of the scope and
challenges of government affairs work since our initial meeting about a
year ago. In particular, I appreciate more the important internal role that
GA plays in supporting other units at Enron (the academics tend to focus
more on external actions in the public policy arena).

I hope that I was able to contribute to the projects that I was assigned.
The GA Assessment (more below) was particularly interesting, and clearly is
important for decision making about GA activities. I also enjoyed assisting
GA's work with EIM's steel traders.

Please give my thanks to your employees with whom I worked. My overall
assessment is that they work extremely hard and are dedicated to solving
Enron's GA-related problems. I thank Maureen and Ginger for taking care of
the logistical details and making me feel part of the GA team. I also thank
Gus, Earleen, and the other support staff. Finally, I want to recognize
Lisa Yoho: I really enjoyed working with her and feel she's an important
contributor to the GA team.

If you need anything from Rice, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I hope that we continue to keep in touch.



Cordially,

Re:     Government Affairs Assessment Process: A Brief Analysis
Date:   August 2, 2001


This brief analysis is based upon my assignment with Amr Ibrahim and
Elizabeth Linnell to review the ""Accomplishments for the Period November
2000 to April 2001"" reports filed by the GA professional staff. It is also
based upon some of the academic literature on ""valuation"" of business
activities where we are interested not only on the costs side (in a
traditional cost center approach) but also the benefits (moving towards a
profit center approach). The importance of considering benefits is that it
allows the senior GA managers to assign professional staff to areas
reflecting their highest benefit (considering the opportunity costs of that
assignment). Additionally, it should allow senior GA managers to articulate
more clearly GA needs (e.g., budget requests, personnel) to internal
constituents at Enron.

What I saw
Data were collected from about 60 GA professionals in the Accomplishment
Report for the period November 2001 to April 2001. Each individual was
asked to list his or her accomplishments, the unit it served, the area
(e.g., deal support, origination, etc.), its value, and the methodology used.

Regarding the accomplishments done during the period, about 25% involved
activities aimed at other Enron units, such as improving communications
between GA/PA and ENA and EES in the New York market, developing a GA
website with EBS, and working with EIM to design a risk management program
for a client. About 75% of activities were externally oriented (although in
support of internal Enron customers) primarily towards regulatory and
legislative bodies at various levels of government.

Very few individuals provided data for value and methodology. Probably less
than 20% of the activities were valued and the methods used varied widely.
For these relatively few entries, GA professionals claimed a contribution
of $6.43 billion, a figure that appears to be highly overstated.

My analysis would be despite the considerable efforts that went into
compiling and completing these reports, that senior GA management has not
gained significant insights as to the value of these activities or as to an
accurate methodology to calculate such values.


What is needed
If our goal is the identity and measurement of GA activities, it is crucial
that these be tied to the broad strategies of Enron. Otherwise, we run the
risk of creating a system that desires ""A"" but rewards ""B.""

Thus, the first step needs to be the identification of the most important
broad strategies of GA. The ""Government Affairs/PR Communications"" report
appears to be a first step: it identified such strategies as (1) business
unit support; (2) create open markets and other business opportunities; and
(3) regulatory and governmental risk identification and mitigation.

For each of these strategies, some primary objectives need to be
articulated. For example, for business unit support, some objectives might
be: (1) information provision: timeliness and accuracy; (2) transaction
support; (3) new market development; and (4) asset protection [note: these
are just my ""off the cuff"" objectives].

Then, we need to look a ways to assess the attainment of each of these
objectives. For example, with information provision, we might go to our
users in other units of Enron to see how they would rate (perhaps on a 1-5
scale) such things as timeliness, accuracy, criticality for their
transaction, etc. We might also count the number of projects, meetings,
memos, etc. that GA produced with information for other units. We would do
likewise for the other objectives.

Note that the ""Balanced Scorecard Approach"" (BSA) may be used to make such
linkages and measures. The BSA is a strategy implementation tool where
activities are measured and compared to the goals of the firm. BSA gives
guidelines on the types of measures that are appropriate: it considers such
things as leading and lagging indicators (training would be a leading
indicator as it occurs before the activity; profits on a trade would be a
lagging indicator as it is the result of various activities), and financial
and non-financial measures. The goallike oursis to try to take into account
enough measures of the activity to make a satisfactory judgment of its
merits. I believe if you could create such a system, you would have a much
better idea of how to deploy your employees across projects, how much to
charge other units for GA services, and when to outsource GA activities.

In order to do what I have suggested, I think that you will have to devote
more resources. One possibility is to assemble a small team with members
from GA and one or two operating units (e.g., a director from EES who has
some GA interaction) to create this systematic approach to GA evaluations.
You also might consider adding an outsider to this process.

Finally, I am amenable to discussing a role for me in the process. I plan
to continue to work on this valuation framework in an academic way (e.g.,
for scholarly journals) with Marc Epstein, one of my colleagues in
accounting, who has done much with the balanced scorecard approach. Once we
have developed a clearer framework, we would like to create a practitioner
version that might be useful for your GA analysis.

Reporting from Providence Rhode Island......although the plenary sessions of the NGA summer meeting have not focused on energy issues, DOE secretary Spence Abraham did make a short presentation to the Natural Resorces Committee this morning.  He used only one visual, and it was pretty effective---very simple/one page.  The message was 175 Quadrillion BTU's will be the nation's energy needs by 2020, 48 could be met by conservation, 98 is today's supply (domestic and imported) which leaves 29 quads as the shortfall.  The last line showed that between 1991-2000, domestic supply had only increased by 1 quad. He was very well received by the governors (committee members attending were Vilsack-IA, Keating-OK,Geringer-Wy, Minner-DE, Johnson-NM, Hoeven-ND, McCallum-WI)

Governor Davis showed up for the end of Abraham's comments and did his normal personal pat on the back for how well his state has done in conservation and how they had many power plants on line.  He made a slightly disparaging comment about Wyoming/Cheney needing to get on the bandwagon for conservation, at which point Geringer got a bit testy and cautioned Davis to be ""careful"" about whether he wanted to get into that debate.

Most of the questions by the Governors to Abraham focused on transmission.  Abraham inidicated that federal eminent domain was intended as a last resort if the states can't get it done and that he is sensitive to the governors wanting local control.  Several Governors expressed their hope that they could get transmission issues solved on their own, and that if they did not, they were open to further ""discussion"" of having FERC help them.

After the meeting, Gov. Vilsack (chairman of the committee) and Gov. Keating (vice chair) held a press conference, along with next year's committee chairs,  Hoeven/ND and Minner/DE.  They presented the NGA comprehensive energy policy resolution--NR-18 (I had forwarded it on to most people on this list last week) and talked about how much there was that both dems and republicans had agreed on in the document.  The reporters asked several questions on the eminent domain....both Vilsack and Keating again stated that they wanted to see if states could get the job done and if not, they were open to further discussions with the feds.

I'll be here thru tomorrow.  Page me or leave me a voice mail if you want to discuss in more detail.

All,
   I will be out of the office on Monday, August 13. My older son stepped on a piece of glass and cut a two inch wound in his right foot. The glass cut a main vain just under his big toe and required stitches to close the wound. Because of the area of the wound it bleeds with every turn of the foot and he MUST stay off of it for 24 to 48 hours to allow healing to begin. For this reason I am keeping him home for one day to make sure he stays off of it.

Under Access to Transmission I would change it to say that ""Not all Users on the System take service in a non-discriminatory manner.""  Utilities can't discriminate versus like users.
 
Under Generation - I would change ""optional"" to Optimal.
 
I don't also understand the 99%.  Easier to say 100%*   * - Public Power recipricoity issues.
 
Thanks,
 
Jim




David, some suggestions (I cannot write directly on your presentation for some reason, so please call me at 713-301-3421 if you have questions.)
 
Add ""real time"" price
Add costs and ""risk premiums""
Add Generation ""and Transmission""
Add lack of ""valid"" grid information
Change the benefits to ""Better ability for customers to utilize numerous energy products, including forward hedging tools and demand side management.""  [[Which Enron sells!]]
 
Change Market to ""Wholesale Market""  open
 
Also, why do you say 99% open after RTOs?  Is this due to publics that don't participate?  If so, then maybe say ""100% open to the extent that non-jurisdictional entities, such as federal power agencies and state power authorities, participate""  or name some examples, such as TVA and BPA.  





 

 

 

 

Please find the latest draft of the RTO slide for inclusion in next week's 3Q Analyst Conference Pitchbook. Greg Whalley will be presenting the Wholesale Section which will include a brief RTO's discussion.

Please take a minute and review and let me know if you have any comments/concerns with the wording. 

Kind Regards.

"The best outcome is that there is an obligation to dispose of load through this but the mechanism is negotiated.

Jim

 

It's really an ""either - or"" situation in that either the bid is set up to request wholesale power with the utility retaining the customer or as a retail transaction in which we bid for the customers.  The only way to have both is if we allow the utilities to decide this issue themselves, in which case, FE, DPL and Allegheny will go the wholesale route and AEP and Cinergy will go the retail route.  The problem is also giving too much control to the utilities to game the outcomes in favor of their perceived business interests and those of their affiliates.  EES obviously wants it to be retail.  And from an ENA perspective, the wholesale power delivered under the utilities' proposals would have to be load-shaped, which may not interest ENA as much.  We are in the EES vs. ENA question, but under my reading of the statute, it requires a retail bid as my comments indicate. 

 

Janine --

I want to make sure that our comments allow both a retail option and a wholesale option.  Let's also focus the PUCO on the fact that bidding leading to negotiations is the best solution, allows for creativity.

Jim

 

At the conclusion of the meeting on competitive bidding, parties were encouraged to file comments at the PUCO.  Below is a draft that reflects the subjects discussed and where I think we ought to land, based on our meeting earlier this week.  I would like to file these soon, so please get back to me.

In the meeting there was a lot of discussion on the RFP process.  Of course the utilities wanted to be able to draft the RFP, choose the winning bidder, have their affiliates participate in the process and have very scanty PUCO oversight, all of which I fought vigourously.  I was asked however if Enron could provide info on what should and should not be in an RFP.  On the should part, I said we could probably provide some insights, but that the should not category would probably be a ""I know it when I see it"" call.  Having said that, any input on this question would be appreciated.

That would be outsanding.
"This memo follows up on our discussion this morning.

With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to 
Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following:

1.  5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from 
the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).

2.  Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the 
trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).

3.  With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the 
""Cross Commodity Trading Group"" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and 
use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only 
employee).  This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we 
need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading 
groups staying within their VAR limits).  However, I do see the need for a 
true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability 
trades accross the commodities that we trade.  This structure may help to 
start us down this path.

Please let me know what you think.

I need to make you aware of a potential lawsuit we may be filing jointly with 
Columbia Energy Services/Nisource against TDC Energy regarding a CES 
transaction.  I don't have every detail yet, but I wanted to fill you in 
because this is moving quite quickly.

TDC Energy is a small privately owned producer that had several deals with 
CES that ENA acquired in last year's transaction.  Four of those transactions 
were costless collars that are deep in the money for us.  TDC is disputing 
the existence of these collars because CES never sent confirmations for 
them.   We have taken the position with CES that if TDC defaults it is CES' 
exposure, not ENA's.  The total value of these collars as of today is 
approximately $4,800,000.   I have been working with Jeff Hodge on this issue 
and we believe that, because of several different reasons, ENA should file 
the lawsuit with TDC jointly.  I'll be happy to meet with you if you're 
interested and explain the reasons for this.

In addition, ENA has other deep in the money fixed priced transactions with 
TDC worth an estimated $5,000,000 (unofficially from R. Diamond in Credit)   
TDC has not disputed these transactions and so far all is fine with these; 
however, we fear that TDC may be facing financial difficulties--if they go 
bankrupt, we have exposure on the $5,000,000 of fixed price transactions, 
plus potentially all or part of the other $4,800,000 of financial collars.  
Jeff Hodge is meeting today with CES' outside attorneys to discuss where we 
should file the lawsuit and I get the impression that it is already drafted 
and will be filed very soon.  Please let me know if you want to talk through 
this.

I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list 
of agreed apon tasks.

1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we 
have huge business risk if it blows up. 

 -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to 
maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  
        (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds 
like it should be a high priority)

2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to 
long hours on the part of our back office staff.  

 -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to 
address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are 
expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add 
hardware and reduce the time problems.

3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately 
combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real 
time risk.
TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the 
traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by 
the               traders to meet their needs. 

 -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in 
consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to 
come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.

4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is 
leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made 
progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the 
next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.

5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin 
Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements 
deals and volume management deals in the east.

6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).

7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their 
books through an interface with Houston.  

 -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its 
worthwile to put servers in Portland.    

 -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering 
all his needs.

Regulatory:

Based on the on-going CA PUC hearings and opinions of Enron legal and 
regulatory groups, it seems that the Commission is likely to increase tariff 
rates by anywhere from 10 to 20% (PG&E and SCE are arguing for a 30% increase 
- not realistic). The critical decision is to leave EES direct-access 
customers on that tariff. Alternatively, if the PUC rules to end the rate 
freeze, eliminates the existing CTC credits and does not allow EES customers 
to switch to this tariff, we stand to lose somewhere between $600-650 
million, as EES would have to serve their customer loads by buying expensive 
CA power during 2001.

A 10% increase in tariff rates results in ~$50 million loss for EES. However, 
if the tariff is extended beyond 2001, it will create additional value for 
EES (the tariff is lower than Cal-02 power prices). 

CA Gov. Davis met with Clinton yesterday where they have decided to extend 
the emergency status in the state.

Ken Lay is scheduled to meet with Davis today to address the following topics:
 - clarify any inaccurate information about Enron's role in CA markets
 - urge the Governor to not go overboard with this situation and give the 
""world"" to the CA utilities
 - remind about the upside PG&E and SCE will realize from high valuations of 
hydro plants (increased almost three-fold from a year ago)

Hearings and oral arguments will continue this week. CA PUC decision is 
expected to come on Jan-4th, followed by multiple appeals.

Credit issues:

 - Enron is attempting to reduce credit exposure with PG&E, whereby PG&E will 
assign its out-of-the-money trades with Avista and MS to EPMI and    EES will 
assign its in-the-money positions with PG&E to EPMI, creating an off-set. 
These assignments will reduce PG&E exposure by ~$265 MM,    in exchange for 
Avista and MS exposures.
 - PUC is not likely to rule removal of retail tariff retroactively (to May 
99) - this will enforce EES position in collecting its accounts receivable 
from    PG&E of ~$150 MM (so far, they have not paid Enron on the premise of 
retroactive ruling).

Market Risk:

12/27 VaR is $7.8 MM - limit violation. An increase of $0.5 MM because of:
 - addition of long Feb-01 positions at MidC
 - overall increase in prices
 - incorrectly booked trades at PJM (50 MWs Cal-03 Long instead of a Short)

My suggestion, at a high level, to Don Black and Dennis Benevides to sell MWs 
in both East and West in order to reduce VaR. However, because of the 
holidays the liquidity in the market is very scarce.

"No, The canadian contract is only for canadian business.  I do not recall the 
assignment when El Paso and the Canadian group split, however, I do no want 
to allow the canadian agreement to be used for U S business.  



	Bridgette Anderson@ENRON
	02/21/2001 03:58 PM
		


No, maybe I am missing something.  Unless I am reading this incorrectly El 
Paso Merchant Energy Canada Inc. assigned all assests and contracts to El 
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. effective 12/31/00, therefore assigning K#96054452 
(10/1/00).  My line of thinking is that we will still have two masters for El 
Paso.  Also, since the master was written to cover Canadian business wouldn't 
it make this K a little broader for all transactions? 



Dan J Hyvl@ECT
02/21/2001 03:39 PM


No, They are with two separate entities which each need to stay in place.  Am 
I missing something?



	Bridgette Anderson@ENRON
	02/21/2001 03:17 PM
		


So, would you advise terminating the 10/1/00 agreement effective 3/1/01?  If 
the answer is yes, would we need to send out an letter advising of our 
actions?



Dan J Hyvl@ECT
02/21/2001 03:08 PM


Bridgette,
 I would stay with the April 1, 1998 agreement.  The 10/01/00 agreement was 
with the canadian el paso entity.

	02/21/2001 02:50 PM
		 


Dan,

I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El 
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P..  As you are probably aware, they have gone 
through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep 
especially for EOL purposes.  Please advise.

It is my understanding that cashouts coming from Unify look like regular 
sales and purchases.  The accounts used are as follows:

TYPE                                                                ACCOUNT

Cashout Sale - Third Party                             483
Cashout Sale - Intercompany                       484
Cashout Purchase - Third Party                   803
Cashout Purchase - Intercompany              803?

This is how the FERC module in SAP is mapping them.

Rita/Kris - let me know if my understanding of Unify is correct.






Irene Flynn@ECT
11/02/2000 03:35 PM




See Tom's message regarding cashouts.  Please reply directly to him and copy 
me so I will know how to list these transactions on the tariffs and whether 
the revenue is applicable for TRRC Gross Receipts Tax.  Thanks!

PM 
   
	Enron North America Corp.
	
	

  

I guess the transport tariff is as good a place to refer to cashouts as 
anywhere.  How should they be listed on the tariffs?  And what (NARUC) 
account are cashouts booked under?



Dan J Hyvl
11/02/2000 10:00 AM


  

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract 
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.  
The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, 
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts 
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, 
unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate 
sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be 
in the contract file.  Do you agree?



	Irene Flynn

Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 
01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.  (When did this get assigned to 
HPL?)

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance. DAN

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff. DAN

Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract 
(Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on 
Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); 
Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should 
not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing. DAN

Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm.
Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99
Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99
Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99
Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99, 
03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99.
Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.  DAN
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen AS SOON AS POSSIBLE so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

"Kim,
 The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon 
you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. 
Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price 
is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price 
applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the 
weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to 
include any of the above concepts in the offer.

"I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as 
having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back 
to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with 
CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I 
understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no 
deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under 
these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and 
thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.  George Weissman and Bob 
Hall feel that this is a workable solution.  We will proceed with the 
preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise."

Michael,
 
 Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents 
for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 
2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the 
clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 
below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have 
been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document.

 1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always 
be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less 
than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company.   
I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited 
for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of 
examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that 
Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and 
Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that 
event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from 
Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the 
price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 
3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's 
total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual 
purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ 
would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price 
in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).

 2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should 
Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties 
are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas 
requirements, then no buyback would be applicable.

 3. I have revised the last sentence of the Fixed Price Strategies as you 
requested.

"Ellen,
 The enovate office in Chicago tells me that the addresses in the Contract 
are correct as written and that they have gotten with the people in Houston 
to get them to leave the addresses as contained in the contract.  Regarding 
the Financially Firm language, I would suggest that you line through the word 
Financially in each case where it occurs in the contract, line through the 
entire definition of Financially Firm and have the person who signs for 
Reliant initial each of the line outs.   I do not feel that we need to define 
the term Firm.  Our view of the contract is that the obligations are always 
firm so no further clarification is needed.  Do you concur?  If so, forward 
the signed and initialled contracts together with the signed Transaction 
Agreements and I will have the enovate officer also initial the line outs and 
return a final fully executed contract to you.

Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Regards,
Ellen

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we ""need"" ""financially firm"" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that ""financially firm"" ""needed"" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
""financially firm"" out and ""firm"" substituted.

The definition for ""firm"" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for ""firm"" that is in the GISB as follows:

""Firm"" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that ""Financially Firm""
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of ""Financially Firm"" to just
""firm""?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through ""Financially"" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX ""1"" would have to be
redone to replace ""Financially Firm"" with just ""Firm"".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

"This is in follow-up to the deal transfer matter we discussed this morning.

Julie Meyers called me and stated that Tom Martin had called her to put the 
deal transfer from HPL to ENA on hold till Monday; however, she had already 
moved them in the system.  I asked her to find out if the deals had been 
confirmed under HPL and if so, I would need to prepare a document to transfer 
them from HPL to ENA.  She agreed to send me a list of the deals that had 
been moved and whether or not they had been documented with the

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

Andrew Ozuna

Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>



Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

"George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to ""homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises...""  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and ""fairness"" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,

"check's in the mail.  i made it an even $150.  Let me know if that works. Scala's the Eye-talian place that's kitty-korner from Willow, right?  Coming soon, this hip chef (and part owner of the Willow) is opening up a competing place right across the street from Willow.  Should be interesting.  We gotta dive again before the season's out. (If I can find the freakin' licenses.  I'll start looking in earnest.)

Yeah, we gotta finish the job.  You take out the WTC, you gotta pay.

Best,
Jeff




It was a great weekend. Mellow and raging at the same time. Thanks for 
coming. I'm glad you had a good time with everyone as well, including people 
you hadn't hung out with before. The abalone diving was great, even if I 
can't seem to get one now.

It was $100 for each couple for everything. But you got a lot of people onto 
the reef, so if you want to take that off the bill, that's fine, too.

I guess I'll see you tonight? The chefs are going to cook something up. By 
the way, we stopped in Graton yesterday and went to Scala (because Willow 
was closed, to my utter dismay). But Scala was damn good. We had the Dutton 
Pinot, which was great. I had a homemade ravioli that really hit the spot.

See you later,

Scott

P.S. I agree with everything that guy said in the article you sent out. 
Pacifism is just not feasible in most situations. The world can be too 
selfish and evil for something so extreme to be effective more than 15% of 
the time. We have to go after those motherfuckers. And then be very 
responsible in the aftermath.

"Thanks, Geoff.  May make sense to loop back with the woman at the PUC who contacted Jim originally about this account. Jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a UC account.  Jim was out yesterday and today, but I think that he'll be in tomorrow.  He may want to make the contact.  Jim, thoughts?

All,
I spoke with the customer, Mike Benson. He is not angry, but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service. He understands that we are implementing a large contract with SBC Corp Real Estate, and that it is possible more of his accounts are inadvertantly on the list.  He knows to contact me directly with future issues. I submitted the deal sheet to de-DASR the 2 accounts he identified to Samantha Fite a few moments ago.
I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation.
Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

Geoff Pollard is the SM for Pac Tel.





I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. 
The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. 
""What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed,"" Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. 
The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. 
""There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work,"" Angelides said. 
Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. 
Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, ""are not ready to act."" 
Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. 
How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. 
Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. 
In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. 
The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. 
Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. 
Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. 
Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

Jeff, Gas Daily has an article on DWR activities for purchasing gas.... do you know Pete Garris and is he the guy we want to get together with... or is Balwin's co. going to carry the ball. I remain unclear as to who actually is doing the gas buying..

"The generators are going to go nuts over this.  They'll do all the pounding needed on their own.  Calpine will likely lead the charge, which should be interesting....


Planning""


I think that California needs to make a final decision on whether it wants competitive markets or not.  I wonder if PURPA has anything to say about meeting incremental Utility needs and what that does to the CDWR contracts?

I don't see Enron getting engaged in this quagmire unless there is a clear business reason.

Jim


Importance: High


Dave and company,

Here we go again.  Dave, is this anything you want us to engage in?  Jim, what do you think about this?


Importance: High


The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee over the past few weeks has been
discussing the prospects of state agencies (e.g. the CEC) pursuing a
long-term (1-2 year) strategy of re-introducing centralized, Integrated
Resource Planning in California.  Indeed, some CEC staff have used sought to
obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch
instructions or, perhaps, identification of generation units for
""retirement.""

The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to ""integrated resource
planning.""  The BRPU returns!  Anyway, we will be discussing this further at
the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.

We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes
available.


Importance: High


FYI.  Highlights from today's CPUC meeting.  It is still in progress,
with few energy items remaining.  Regular results memo to follow.

CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to ""integrated resource planning""
with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited
Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding.  Clearly contemplates
utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for
life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset
construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission,
etc.

CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for
reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX).  Will begin new phase re
economic projects.

CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract
amendments.  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision
based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions
could go forward until the Commission acts.  CPUC states that parties
remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on
ordinary review process.  This decision primarily undermines QF contract
amendments with SCE's.

CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation.
PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set
cost of service rates.  CPUC rejects argument.  Duque will concur, but
notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that
CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained
assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that
require market valuation.  It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC
settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered
per that agreement.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws,"" said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. ""If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void."" 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 
""It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,"" Ahern said. ""It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover."" 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. 
Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report. "
"I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to ""homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises...""  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and ""fairness"" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,
Jeff

PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:
?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.
?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.
?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.
?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. 
?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.
?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. 
?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.
?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.
""This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,"" said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  ""The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.""
This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.


 

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding ""litigation.""  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any ""overcollection"" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called ""undercollection"")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the ""filed rate doctrine"" and 2) the so-called ""TURN"" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to ""cooperate"" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the ""special"" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to ""solving"" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a ""dedicated rate component"" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the ""dedicated rate component"" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another ""special"" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Can we talk this week on our response?

On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan for
implementing the suspension of direct access.  Parties have until,
Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.

The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek
Commission approval:

1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP
List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.

2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service
Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,
they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,
2001.

3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer
account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party
verification took place prior to September 20, 2001.

4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after
September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place
on or before Sept. 20th.

5.  Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.

6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still
under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to
process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.


7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a
merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;
requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if
the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.

8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a
customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).

9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights
to another.

10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a
community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be
allowed.

In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for
implementing the suspension.

1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and
accepted).

2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should
require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off
to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the
Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to
receive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay
from the Commission.

3.  The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was
associated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set
forth a proposed affidavit.)

"Since Congressman's Ose's been asking FERC alot of questons about what the ISO, DWR, etc. have been up to, perhaps he could write a ""Dear FERC"" letter saying ""here's what I'm hearing, it sounds serious and you need to investigate, pronto, and get back to me ASAP with your conclusions.""

Best,
Jeff

 

Everyone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an ""Out Of Market"" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market (""OOM"") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and ""the Friday Burrito,"" an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

""There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, ""The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets."" 
9.  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative:




Issue highlighted in blue lettering. This is being researched internally and
an ISO response on how these transactions are being handled should be
forthcoming, I would think.

and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time.

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

10.  Here is an e-mail from the intrepid and vigilant Kit Blair, in Volume Management, who first brought this scam to my attention.
 

Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.   

-Kit"
"Don't know.  I'll find out.  Any sensitivity if we had?  Thanks.

Jeff,

I know you said you were participating in the CSUS event, but is Enron
actually giving any money?  If so, I'm just curious as to how much.

Scott"
"I'll forward to them.




Does someone at the Chamber want to see this?



Attached for your review and comment is a revised draft of the application for rehearing to be filed on Friday the 28th.  There are two primary changes.  The California Chamber of Commerce has been added to the application and an argument has been added that the Decision contradicts the most recent legislative intent expressed in ABX2 9 that direct access continue, at least for aggregation and community choice purposes.
 
Any and all comments will be very much appreciated.  Also, I would appreciate it if Sue Mara would forward the document to her contact at the Chamber so that they can also review the draft.  Thanks!

"?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

"I based Sep off the CNG index.

 

The Boston Differential for Sep 2001 is ($.1187).


 

The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.

Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.

Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.  I don't know if you need to be involved or not.

 

Hi Chris,

I realize that you are getting bugged from a few of us in Canada for the Boston Differential numbers.  I am in Accounting and I am in desperate need of the Boston Differential for August and September so that I can finish my invoicing for the month.  I really have to have these numbers by the end of the day today (latest).  Sorry for being a pest, but I am starting to panic!  Please send these numbers to me or Nicole Laporte, as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Kelly

 



 

Chris,
We just require August and September, we already have July.
Would it possible to get the differential number before Wednesday? Our Accounting group requires this number for invoicing and they are a few weeks late with their August invoice and require the differential immediately.
Please let me know,
Thanks,
Nicole

 

Sorry about the delay.  I'm starting to look at this again.  I know you need August and September.  Did you say you also need July?  

I don't know if Canada makes any money off this deal but my book is taking a beating.  Ruth Concannon and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss this deal.  There are some other things going on with this deal that she is aware of.  I should have your prices by them.

Thanks

 

Chris,
Attached is a spreadsheet listing the differential since January 1998.

Nicole, I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter.  Thanks.

Kimat, are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would update to calculate the Tenn Z6 city gate price?  It wasn't very big, and Dick would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost.

While it has been discouraging to see an endless stream of negative news coverage about Enron, we want you to know about some positive news that is starting to emerge.  ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide.  The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20.  The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST.   Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight.  While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging.  We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air.  

Additionally, two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.  We are forwarding them to you for your information.  Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees.

New Enron CEO turns company focus to future ; While workers cope with loss and uncertainty
Noelle Knox

02/18/2002
USA Today
FINAL
B.03
(Copyright 2002)

HOUSTON -- Inside Enron headquarters, employees walk by stacks of moving boxes as they scrounge for pens and Post-it Notes from the empty desks of their laid-off co-workers. On one desk, an employee finds a note that reads: ""I'm not gone, don't take my stuff!"" 
Forgotten behind the headlines of smoking guns, Aspen ski homes and shredded documents are almost 18,000 employees who work on Enron's power plants and pipelines.
USA TODAY is the first to get a tour inside Enron since its collapse late last year and spend time with Stephen Cooper, the new chief executive, talking about his vision for the future. 
On the 50th floor of executive suites, decorated with rich carpets and velvet-covered chairs, there is a sweeping view of Houston -- a city Enron helped shape with its philanthropy, political donations and corporate muscle. Cooper, however, is only focused on saving part of the company. 
His plan faces monumental challenges. In his words, ""Everybody's betting against us."" 
While many American corporate icons have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the past year -- Kmart, Polaroid, Bethlehem Steel -- the size, speed and sordid details of Enron's collapse have sparked numerous investigations and lawsuits, angered creditors, demoralized employees and ruined its reputation. 
But Cooper -- whose firm Zolfo Cooper worked on the troubles of such companies as Polaroid, Sunbeam and Federated Department Stores - - is adamant Enron can emerge healthy from bankruptcy within a year. 
""I've probably been in more Chapter 11s than anybody in the United States, literally,"" he says. ""This company, by way of business and asset base, by way of management team, by way of predictability of its future business, has more of all of that than most distressed businesses I've ever seen."" 
Cooper's plans 
The company already has sold the energy-trading business that was once considered its crown jewel to UBS Warburg. Although a bankruptcy court and Enron's creditors must first approve any moves, Cooper's plans include: 
* Enron will likely have to give up this skyscraper for a ""more modest habitat,"" Cooper says. 
* The company's new $100 million building across the street from headquarters also is for sale. 
* Even Enron's name blazoned across the top of the nearby Major League Baseball stadium is going to have to go. 
""Out of the ashes, there ought to be something everyone can be proud of a year, or two, or three from now,"" he says. 
Today, the company still has a pipeline network that stretches from Canada to California and from Texas to Florida. And Cooper is betting that business can power the light at the end of the tunnel. 
He wants to keep the North American and South American pipelines and power plants and sell or shut down the rest of the company's businesses, including its broadband network, water utilities and the like. 
That will mean cutting an additional 10% to 20% off Enron's payroll and returning the company to its natural gas pipeline roots of the 1980s. 
But to pull off his plan, Cooper must not only sway his critics, including giant Wall Street creditors, but also motivate thousands of devastated employees. 
""Cooper and (Enron President Jeff) McMahon have one of the toughest jobs in business to keep the people there and keep them motivated,"" says John Whitney, a turnaround expert and professor at Columbia University. 
To lock in 500 key executives, Enron offered $55 million in retention bonuses. Former Enron executives who went to UBS Warburg as part of the sale of the energy-trading business also pocketed multimillion-dollar payoffs. 
And Cooper's pay? 
The New York-based consulting firm Zolfo Cooper will receive $1.3 million a year, plus $1.2 million for each of the eight executives he brought with him to Houston. If Enron emerges from bankruptcy, Cooper's firm will get a $5 million fee. If Enron is liquidated, Cooper will get a fee agreed upon by the creditors and court, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. 
Shattered morale 
Enron's fall from grace has shattered employee morale. 
""It's just so sad,"" says one current employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""On several floors, it looks like the rapture. It looks like people disappeared into space. They're just gone."" 
This employee, just two years away from retirement, watched $160,000 in retirement savings shrink to zero with Enron's stock price. ""Now I'm going to have to work as a greeter at Wal-Mart until I'm 90,"" the employee says. ""It's gone. I just can't make it back."" 
Jorge Garcia, a project controls manager laid off in December, says his friends still at Enron say, "" 'You can tell if you'll be let go soon by your office accommodations. If you've been moved to a cubicle, you probably won't last long.' "" 
That kind of stress takes its toll. 
Downstairs in the company gym, Kathy Kissner, a massage therapist, says that as the company fell apart, employees would call begging for any open appointment or even just five minutes between appointments. 
""I've lost 30 pounds in the last six months"" from long hours and lack of sleep, says Mark Palmer, vice president of communications. 
Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally. It's the hardest part of his job. 
""When people are looking at the prospect of losing enormous amounts of money, they often times get heated. They get emotional and upset,"" he says. ""It's never fun to be at the receiving end, but I've gotten used to it."" 
Blast voice mail 
To motivate the employees, he is trying to focus them on future goals. ""People have two choices: We can spend all of our time living in the past, which is a crazy way to spend your life. You can't change it. Or, we can begin to move beyond the disappointment and the upset and the loss, to focus on the future,"" he says. 
And he has opened up lines of communication. 
Once a week, he sends out a lengthy voice mail, telling employees what has happened during the past week, explaining management changes and timetables. 
When employees call or send him e-mail, he will go find them in the building to answer their questions. And next month, he will hold a meeting with all of the employees in Houston to explain the details of his strategy to bring the company out of bankruptcy. 
This kind of candid communication is essential, he says. 
""We are not trying to eliminate bad news. We are not trying to make it just good news. What we are trying to do is to eliminate uncertainty,"" he says. ""People can live with either one of those, good or bad. What they can't live with is uncertainty."" 
And while some still say Enron's future is uncertain, Cooper is certain of one thing: 
""The lives and reputations of 20,000 people shouldn't be trash- canned because a handful of geniuses decided to run wild,"" he says. ""People ought to keep in perspective that we've got a lot of really tremendous people here, and for the sake of a couple bad apples, we shouldn't blowtorch the entire field.""

The Nation Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron Litigation: Those who helped fell the energy giant would be targeted, Stephen Cooper says.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. is planning a broad legal assault against those who helped bring the company down, according to acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper, the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks ago to put the company back on the road to solvency. 
Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and rapid, although he declined to identify specific targets.
""Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate,"" said Cooper, a principal with Zolfo Cooper, a New York consulting firm that specializes in corporate restructuring. ""I think you will see something sooner as opposed to later."" 
The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality play, and all are potential defendants. 
Enron filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2, following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions with partnerships controlled by company employees. The nation's seventh-largest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it disclosed losses tied to the off-the-books partnerships, wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than 6,000 jobs. 
An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least $1 billion in recent losses, while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits. Directors and executives, including former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, failed to curb the missteps of subordinates, the report concluded. It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen, Enron's auditor, and Vinson & Elkins, one of its outside law firms. 
Still Sorting Out All the Issues 
Cooper, who occupies Skilling's old office on the 50th floor of Enron's mirrored office tower in downtown Houston, said the company has not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they earned from partnership transactions. That would include former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, former Enron Global Finance executive Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F. Glisan. 
""I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation,"" Cooper said. 
Cooper and his team are still ""sorting out issues"" related to Enron's financial statements and the value of its trading book, the contracts that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading operation. Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection, the value of those contracts has eroded to about $1 billion from about $7 billion. 
""I certainly don't believe at this particular point in time that anybody is engaging in transactions that aren't completely above board,"" Cooper said. ""We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a regular basis our financial statements, which I believe, in the main, will be accurate."" Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace Andersen, which it fired. 
Enron already has filed a $10-billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc. alleging that its cross-town rival withdrew from a proposed merger with Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company. Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented the depths of its financial problems and lost its investment-grade credit rating. 
The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the market-dominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built. The name will change, and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and power plants--the kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained. 
Cooper's style, too, is unlike Lay's grandfatherly and professorial demeanor and Skilling's hard-driving image. Cooper insists on being called by his first name and dresses casually at the office, complete with baseball cap. He hasn't decorated Skilling's wood-paneled, deadbolted office. 
To keep up employee morale, Cooper said he visits workers in response to e-mail and sends out weekly, unscripted voicemail updates. An all-employee meeting will be held soon, he said. 
Enron's overhaul is well underway. 
Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest pipeline, 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas, which was a condition of the $1.5 billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger. Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energy-trading operation to New York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a no-cash deal that would supply Enron with a cut of any future profit. 
What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines, including one that runs from Texas to California, and electricity generating plants. Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General, its Oregon utility, as well as many of the international power plants and other assets whose poor performance helped sink the company. 
Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading because ""we haven't settled on a final configuration yet. But it will be substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron. 
""The company, if you remove the trading from the rest of the business, it's actually got a very good, very solid, very revenue- and cash-flow- and earnings-predictable business, which is really its power and pipes business,"" Cooper said. ""So in my view, there is an eminently reorganizable entity here."" 
'Not Going to Wallow and Linger' 
Cooper expects to present ""a fairly on-point direction"" for reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to have settled on a new version of the company within a year. 
""We're going to move this process forward very quickly. We're not going to wallow and linger in Chapter 11 for a day longer than we have to."" 
Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold, Cooper said he is ""not of that mind,"" adding that in his 30-year career of reorganizing companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business. Those cases all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate, he said. 
Enron has a bit of that. Although it leases its Houston headquarters, Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door. It has received $40 million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project. 
Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a post-mortem on Enron, but he did acknowledge the ""very labor-intensive"" process of sorting through ""hundreds upon hundreds"" of so-called special purpose entities, which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to finance projects separate from the company's balance sheet and for other legitimate purposes, such as a sale and lease-back of a building. 
Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the extent of Enron's liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each vehicle, he said. A team of about 10 Zolfo Cooper employees, an unusually large number, is being assigned to Enron, Cooper said. 
""There's a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not versus were they accounted for properly or not. Both of these are being looked at. We'll just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that gets sorted out,"" Cooper said. 
Special purpose entities ""are not good or bad, they're just instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial flexibility to better manage their business, to better manage their balance sheet to fit the needs of their business,"" Cooper said. 
""The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk [from Enron to the partnerships] and the failure to disclose and the suspension of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get into a position where they had divided loyalties"" by working for both Enron and the partnerships, he said. 
""What we saw here was a case where they weren't constructed properly, they weren't reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both sides of the transaction, you couldn't have really an arm's-length transaction. It's kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a prenuptial agreement."" 
Despite its size, the Enron reorganization is much like every other he has handled, Cooper said. Those included Federated Department Stores Inc., Polaroid Corp. and Malden Mills. 
Unique to Enron, however, is the furor surrounding the rapid and stunning collapse of the business, Cooper said. 
""It's become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of people directly involved in the company, but it's become a lightning rod to coalesce all of these other national interests"" involving such issues as accounting and corporate governance, Cooper said. 
""I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic constituencies, a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start for our employees,"" Cooper said. 
""It's sort of like when your car breaks down and you're in the middle of nowhere and you end up hating the car. You're kicking the tires. You're kicking the bumpers. After you get over it, you realize that it's still a good car. You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep going.""

Subject: How to Explain Enron to Your Children

A variation of a folkloric explanation of economic systems

FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.

FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take
care of them, and sells you the milk.

COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbors help take care of them and you
share the milk.

TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes both and denies
they ever existed and drafts you into the army. Milk is banned.

CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd
multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.

ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your
publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your
brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an
associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
via
an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option
on one more.

P.S. When the sham is finally uncovered, you and the other executives
siphon
off all the companies assets, freeze the assets of the peons working on the
farm, and then tell them that there is no use crying over spilled milk."

"Does this email still work or is Enron trying to control all info in and out of the building?

 

JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii....................    

I'm ok.  I'm leaving.  Talk to you later and thanks.


 

I have all of my enron friends in my thoughts. I'm really sorry about what's
going on.

"The person at Select Nat Gas interested in the Trailblazer capacity is Calvin Schultz, phone number 303-797-3388."
"These are my notes on flowing gas.  Tetco will be the problem pipeline.  I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.  I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.  I'm using the following formula

	MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price 

They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.  It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.  If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

Who knows what volumes are going to be?

 

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

Do you know if Bruce McDaniels still works at Virginia Power?  
"consider it tossed

 

Toss it.


 

that sounds good to me, unless i hear from you in 30 min or so i'll toss what we have from them.

 

Chris,

The plant was faxing this to Enron for them to determine gas scheduling. Since I have become more involved, I don't think the plant needs to fax this over to you/Justin/Kevin any longer.

If you agree, I will inform the plant.

MM

 

Vince Hawkes is faxing Justin Fernandez a daily generation and gas plan sheet.  Kevin Brady is in the group that Justin was in before he left and Kevin is delivering this report to me everyday.  Is this something that we should continue to get?"

"My bunkmate, Troy, would like to speak to your cleaing person.  He's thinking about hiring someone to clean his apartment.  What do you think?"
"Per VNG's request, ENA released 700 dt of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2001.  Yesterday, CGAS informed me that Nabisco has not paid any of their bills.  CGAS was under the impression that ENA should be paying Nabisco's bill.  I told CGAS to find chat with the company doing the nominations for Nabisco and to keep me informed."
"Recommendation for ENA Pools
1st choice  Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition.
2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow
3rd choice  Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.

I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck.  Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.  When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.  I have not done that.  I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  

Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following.
	1.  Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket.
	2.  ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition.
	3.  The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.

Items to consider
If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.  Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.  I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.  The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.  Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.

Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.  On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.

Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.  I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.

The ISO suggests the PX fix this by anchoring its Adjustment Bids=20

To effectuate this change, the PX would have to impose a new rule that=20
Adjustment Bids be within $125 of the=20

The ISO also argued that the Commission should impose reporting requirement=

"Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and 
therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego 
has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the ""California"" 
markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of 
costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential 
refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are 
being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.

I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:

In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had 
ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had 
not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its 
customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required 
would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has 
merely conditioned its rates ""subject to refund.""  Accordingly, it is 
inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits.
San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, 
although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of 
insolvency.  It has simply said that ""there is no assurance that the actual 
wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially 
may be ordered.""
San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This 
allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability 
calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.  
This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the 
Commission March 9 order. 
The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given 
that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in 
the market for years - ""pending a final nonappealable order in these 
proceedings.""  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 
order finding that it would not order cost based rates.
This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to 
FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of 
wholesale power ""in the California markets"" not just for sales in the ISO and 
PX markets."
"Tim and I went over your piece.  We like the airline analogy and worked with 
it in the ""not a big deal"" section and corrected the facts.  We also added a 
third bullet under the tariff discussion.

"FYI




On 3/14/01, FERC granted EPMI and Duke's request for rehearing of Arizona 
Public Service interconnection procedures:

APS is required to specify a time in the interconnection process after which 
a generator is no longer subject to additional studies (we pointed out the 
VEPCO limitation that no further studies are required after the 
Interconnection Agreement is signed or filed unsigned at FERC).
APS is required to include in its procedures the study criteria (for example, 
Form 715) that it uses for system impact studies.

These changes are helpful as FERC continues to build on previous orders in 
other utilities' interconnection procedure dockets.
"
"By its January 8 order, the FERC clarified that it did not intend to preclude 
the PX from engaging in bilateral forward contracting  and that the PX was 
free to remove spot market components from its forward contracting rate 
scheduling.  In its request for rehearing, the PX argued that: (1) FERC had 
failed to fix a just and reasonable rate, (2) FERC did not remove the ongoing 
prohibition on the IOUs trading in its markets, (3) the January 8 order 
prohibited it from operating a spot market and that prohibition was unduly 
discriminatory, and (4) FERC failed to provide a viable alternative to its 
forward market rate schedule.  FERC dismissed the PX's request for rehearing 
of its January 8 order, finding that all of the PX's concerns emanate from 
the FERC's December 15 order not its January 8 order..   See attached order.

"Gary Porter of Sierra called.  He was very apologetic about not sending us an 
interconnection agreement sooner.  Attached is a draft that has not been 
reviewed by Sierra's executives yet, but I talked Gary into giving it to us 
anyway.  

Concerning our transmission request, Gary indicated that Sierra will have to 
perform a study because some other parties are supposedly ahead of us in the 
queue that would affect the available transmission capacity.  He referred me 
to a table on the following OASIS cite showing the competing transmission 
requests.  Stan or Don - please look at this table to see if you think 
Sierra's position has any merits.  I'll give you more details in person.  
Some tariff interpretation issues may also be involved depending upon whether

"Some comments from Tim on the outline

Because the prices are based on L3Day NYMEX prices, when two out of three 
prices have already been posted, it is impossible for parties to hedge their 
risk for November.  [For your information but not for the filing - We have a 
big position for November so we need to get this pushed off until December or 
we could lose alot of money].
By basing the caps on heat rates from 1999, the ISO assumed that this was the 
proper test period.  This is not a good test year given that generators lost 
alot of money in 1999.


From: James D Steffes@ENRON on 10/27/2000 11:09 AM CDT


Here is the outline of some points to make in the filing today.



"
"We have put together the following list of issues for the request for 
rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input 
about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who 
will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests 
for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001.

We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap 
and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit
$150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?)
Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not 
be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts.
The FERC should clarify its statement that ""to the extent the IOUs' resources 
exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at 
wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules.""  A literal 
interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and 
prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their 
generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options 
but we are concerned about less liquidity.
Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request 
for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from 
Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs.
We oppose the 27-month refund period
We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF)
The FERC should not have rejected Dynegy & Reliant complaint concerning being 
paid the cost of cover for exports"
"As you may already know, the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a 
protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened 
from us in the CPUC's OII case.  Given the timing, we should discuss this on 
our conference call scheduled for tomorrow.

They request that we be required:
to answer their motion on Thursday,
to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering 
production, and
to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, 
specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price.

We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its 
proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose 
their requests for:
the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" -  this would 
prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants.
a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this 
information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant 
to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c).  16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make 
information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state 
regulation of public utilities.  We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not 
apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate 
how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market 
power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it 
should have this information.)  
the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the 
competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the 
Commission's  decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards 
market.  This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get 
information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall 
Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices."
"Attached find key provisions of the CTS tariff that may be useful in 
discussions in the next couple of days."

Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the 
following information by the end of the day today:

How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day 
or as of midnight?
How much of the gas went into California?
What was the average price or the high and low price?

I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and 
more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down.  
I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information 
confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip 
on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268.

yesterday.  I will not be attending.  

In addition, here's a version of a paper Craig Gannett is working on

actions we may be taking.




Joe Hartsoe@ENRON
12/09/99 06:40 AM


Mary-  I have briefly reviewed your re-write and will take it on the plane to 
Houston.  

The tone of the letter is still to Enron centered instead of Cal PX 
centered.  I think you began the process of softening the tone in your 
rewrite, but I think we should go further.  For example, 

We recognised that that the Market Monitor has a difficult task of better 
understanding the unintended consequences of new rules on the Market, and 
Enron wants to help. When we met recently, we thought we were accomplishing 
this shared goal.  Now, as a consequence, you propose to publish a letter 
that blames us for the problems on the __________ and may cause us to be sued 
based on your findings.  As we prepare to defend ourselves, we find ourselves 
at a disadvantage because the severak conclusions and factual findings are 
not supported and we need a better understanding of how you reached several 
of the conclusions in your letter.  As we discussed, I believe a meeting to 
discuss these matters would be helpful to reaching a mutually acceptable 
resolution.  After this meeting, Enron can promptly provide a response that 
better addresses your concerns, as may be necessary.  We would like to help 
the market monitor in these endeavours, but we cannot continue to be placed 
at a disadvantage through those efforts.  ...

In addition, we need to add Walley as the contact instead of Richard.    


   
	
	
	

I agree with the concept of the short letter.  I have drafted some changes: 
some taking more of a conciliatory tone and others suggesting a potential 
settlement proposal.   Due to all the PRC meetings today, I was unable run 
this by anyone, so this product is simply my suggestions.

"Christian asked me to work with Dan Watkiss to prepare a FERC filing to 
terminate EPMI's participation in the PX.  I have asked Dan to get started as 
Christian said we may decide to file as soon as today.  See attached 
explanation.  Does EES also have a participation agreement?  And if so do we 
also need to file a termination for EES?

Dan,
At some point in the incremental meltdown of the PX process, perhaps when we 
default on payment of the large chargeback bill we will receive today or 
tomorrow and the PX takes our remaining collateral, the question will 
suddenly be:  how does one make sure one is not the last man standing?  It 
would seem that if it is possible to ever become a  ""former""   participant in 
the PX and not a ""current"" one, (""current"" being  the word used in the tariff 
to describe who the chargebacks go to) that we would have had, at a minimum, 
to have given notice of termination of our participation in both the Core and 
CTS markets.  Please review this documentation and help us prepare for a 
possible extradited extraction from the PX.  Thanks.----cgy

I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate 
EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to 
the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to 
terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale 
agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I 
prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing 
necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 
60-day notice period.

I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter.

Steve
